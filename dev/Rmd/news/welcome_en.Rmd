### First, a thanks. 
Our launch in April 2022 was an enormous success -- and we're thrilled you're interested in what <i><b>Sus</b></i> has to offer.

### Second, a story about active living. 
<a target = '_blank' href = 'https://www.activeagingcanada.ca/participants/get-active/active-living/what-is-active-living.htm'>Active living</a> refers to people's ability to integrate physical activity into everyday routines, like biking to the grocery store or walking to work.

With a dataset built by McGill professor Nancy Ross and her team, Sus demonstrates which boroughs, neighbourhoods, and streets have the highest and lowest active living potential in the Montreal region. But that's not all.

The beauty of Sus is its ability to put datasets in conversation with each other. In practice that means that on our platform, you can analyze the relationship between neighbourhoods that have the <b>highest active living potential</b> with those <b>that have the highest number of people who drive to work</b>.

Which neighbourhood would you predict would have the best active living potential and the most amount of people driving to work?

Click through to find out. (Hint: it has the word "mount" in it.)

### Third, a new feature! 
Who provided our active living potential data? Where did we source the dataset that informed our driving to work variables? Great questions!

In our brand-new data transparency feature, we tell you exactly where the information powering Sus's maps comes from. Public, private, census, city, province -- it's all available by clicking on top-right button.

What's more? You can download the dataset for your own research purposes!
