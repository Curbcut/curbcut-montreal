### First, a thanks. 
Our launch in April 2022 was an enormous success -- and we're thrilled you're interested in what <i><b>Curbcut</b></i> has to offer.

If you'd link to rewatch the launch or share it, <a target = '_blank' href = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5QYpmLOlOE'>click here</a>!

### Second, a story about active living. 
<a target = '_blank' href = 'https://www.activeagingcanada.ca/participants/get-active/active-living/what-is-active-living.htm'>Active living</a> refers to people's ability to integrate physical activity into everyday routines, like biking to the grocery store or walking to work.

With a dataset built by McGill professor Nancy Ross and her team, Curbcut demonstrates which cities, boroughs and neighbourhoods have the highest and lowest active living potential in the Montreal region. But that's not all.

The power of Curbcut is its ability to put datasets in conversation with each other. For example, you can analyze the relationship between neighbourhoods that have the <b>highest active living potential</b> with those <b>that have the highest number of people who drive to work</b>.

Curbcut shows that there is a strong negative relationship between these two variables: neighbourhoods with high active living potential tend to have low amount of people driving to work. That is good news from a sustainability perspective.

In fact, there is only a single neighbourhood in the region that has both high active living potential and a high proportion of people driving to work. Can you guess which it is?

Click through to find out. (Hint: it has the word "mount" in it.)

### Third, a new feature! 

Who provided our active living potential data? Where did we source the dataset that informed our driving to work variables? Great questions!

In our brand-new data export feature, we tell you exactly where the information powering Curbcut's maps comes from. Simply click the top-right button and choose "Export data".

What's more? If we have permission to share the dataset you're looking at, you can download it yourself, either as a CSV spreadsheet or as a GIS shapefile.
