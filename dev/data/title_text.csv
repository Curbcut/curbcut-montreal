canale,main,"The CanALE dataset (developed by Prof. Nancy Ross and her team) captures four key elements related to active living environments: population density, points of interest, street grid, and proximity of transit service."
canale,extra,"<p>A safe and inviting pedestrian realm is not distributed equally across socio-demographic factors. The risks of pedestrian injuries and fatalities are higher in low-income and racialized communities where residents often rely on walking as a daily mode of transport but where the local environment is not necessarily inviting and safe.<p>In addition to evidence pointing towards large discrepancies in the provision of walkable urban space across income and racial lines, concern has been raised with regard to the possible gentrification and displacement impacts of improved pedestrian infrastructure. In other words, who can afford to live in walkable neighbourhoods?<br><p>Further resources:<ul><li><a href= ''>Thomas Herrmann, William Gleckner, Rania A.

mode_switch,main,"Based on 2016 commuting data, we quantify possible reductions in VMT and GHG by identifying car trips that could be shifted to cycling based on distance, elevation change and other factors."
mode_switch,extra,"<p>The transportation sector is a major contributor to Canada's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions which are linked to global climate change. Reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT) over the long term is increasingly recognized as the key to reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector but has not received as much attention as needed.<p>The primary objective of this study is to investigate the potential for reducing VMT and GHG emissions by shifting short car trips to cycling in Montreal. Based on commuting data from the 2016 Canadian Census, commuting patterns were explored. Two scenarios were introduced to model environmental effects of a modal shift towards cycling based on characteristics of current bicycle trips.<p>The results showed that enhanced cycling commuting can reduce VMT and GHG emissions from car travel. Other mitigation measures are necessary for achieving GHG emissions reduction targets.<br><p><i>Module lead authors: Qiao Zhao, Kevin Manaugh</i>"

pedestrian_ct,main,The capacity for pedestrian social distancing is a capacity measurement that determines the percentage of a neighbourhood’s population that can make local trips on foot at the same time while respecting ‘social distancing’ regulations.
pedestrian_ct,extra,"<p>Using open data from Montreal's open data portal as well as OpenStreetMap, it was possible to calculate the total surface area of sidewalks, neighbourhood parks, and pre-Covid pedestrian streets. Summing these surface areas gets us the neighbourhood's total walkable surface area. It is then possible to calculate how many residents can ‘fit’ into the pedestrian realm while respecting ‘social distancing’ regulations of 2 meters (total walkable surface area divided by the surface area of a circle with a 2-meter radius, that is 12.54 square meters). Finally, we normalize the value by representing it as a percentage of the residential population. Neighbourhoods where less than 100% of the local population can make trips on foot at the same time are above capacity and more at risk of overcrowding from local pedestrian trips. <p>While it is still important to take into account pedestrian flows coming from external neighbourhoods (some data on pedestrian flows obtained from 2016 TrajetMtl data is presented in this research), the measurement’s focus on local pedestrian capacity is especially relevant during a pandemic situation where shelter in place and travel restrictions have generally led to a rise in local trips and a decline in trips from other neighbourhoods.<br><p><i>Module lead author: Samuel Kohn</i>"
pedestrian_da,main,"Compare the pedestrian capacity for social distancing metric across a variety of other variables, such as walkable access to amenities, income level, immigration, visible minorities, population density, etc."
pedestrian_da,extra,"The data shows us that the ability to safely navigate pedestrian space tends to be much lower in DAs with lower incomes as well as DAs with high proportions of visible minorities and immigrants compared to majority white regions of Montreal. While the City’s plans to increase walkable urban space made some improvements to these discrepancies, there is room for improvement. The interactive data within this platform has the potential to support policy-makers towards making strategic decisions with more equitable outcomes. Below is a policy analysis exemplar using two variables: capacity for pedestrian social distancing and walkable access to key amenities."

pedestrian_sidewalk,extra,"In order to calculate the width of sidewalks in Montreal, we used a spatial dataset published by Montréal Open Data Portal that includes polygons of all sidewalks within the Montreal agglomeration. Using the the object-oriented programming language R, we developed a function which first creates negative buffers inside each sidewalk segment, and then iteratively adjusts the distance of that buffer until the maximum distance is achieved which still produces valid buffer geometry (if the buffer boundaries overlap, the geometry becomes invalid). The outcome is the equivalent of a centreline inside each sidewalk polygon. The last step to determine sidewalk width is to sum the distances between the centreline and both edges of a given sidewalk polygon segment. This process is illustrated below."
climate_risk,main,"Climate change will have increasingly negative impacts on communities across Montreal and Canada, affecting different populations in distinct ways and at varying rates. The City of Montreal did an exercise examining the risk of five climate risks, including heat waves, flooding, heavy rain, drought, and destructive storms, visualised here. "
climate_risk,extra,"<p>The Climate Change Risk datasets are part of the start of the City of Montreal’s iterative process examining potential climate risks for the Montreal region. It includes cartographic representation of five areas: heat waves, flooding, heavy rain, drought, and destructive storms. These climate risks, along with increased temperatures, constitute the primary concerns for the Montreal agglomeration as determined in the 2015-2020 Urban Agglomeration Climate Change Adaptation Plan. The plan includes climate modeling and, projections, and potential impacts on buildings, on municipal operations, as well as environmental and socio-economic impacts. The adaptation plan incorporates several of the City’s other climate-related plans and strategies, and focuses on moving from theory to action, taking into consideration Montreal’s landscape and surroundings. The datasets visualised here are publicly available through the Montreal Open Data Portal. <ul> <li>Heat waves include a range of extreme heat events based on temperature and duration. Montreal has generally seen an upward trend in extreme heat events, most noticeably during the 2000s. Heat waves are especially of concern in Montreal due to more than one quarter (28%) of the island containing heat islands. <li>Flooding, specifically river flooding, refers to flow rate or river level exceeding the critical threshold. The Montreal agglomeration’s flooding concerns primarily locations along the Des Prairies River. <li>Heavy rain includes long term heavy rains, potentially causing rivers to overflow, and short-term heavy rain, often localised, can put strain on infrastructures, cause public health problems, and negatively impact certain natural environments. Episodes of heavy rain are on the upward trend in Quebec, with increased instances observed from 1934 to 2014. <li>Drought includes meteorological drought (amount of precipitation), agricultural drought (soil dryness), hydrological drought (surface and groundwaters), and socioeconomic drought (actions of humans on water resources). Montreal has seen a very slight upward trend in meteorological droughts. <li>Destructive storms include wind storms, hail storms, heavy snowstorms, and freezing rain. Events of freezing rain increased 26% from 1979 to 2008, and heavy snowstorms increased over the past 70 years. No assessment could so far be made in regards to the other storm types.</ul>"
