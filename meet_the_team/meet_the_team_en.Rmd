# The code chunk named css includes all the css for this page. It's exported to all the SUS app, so everything in that css chunk should be starting by '.mtt_mate', so that it's applied only in the content of this script. 'mtt_mate' is the name of the divs' class used here. Every other code chunk which is the presentation for each individual team member should be preceded by '<div class="mtt_mate">' and ended with '</div>' to indicate that every code chunk is a new div, with the 'mtt_mate' css class taken.

```{r david_Wachsmuth,  fig.cap="<strong><big><a href = 'https://upgo.lab.mcgill.ca/' target='_blank'>David Wachsmuth</a></big></strong><br>David Wachsmuth is the Canada Research Chair in Urban Governance at McGill University, where he is also an Associate Professor in the School of Urban Planning. He directs UPGo, the Urban Politics and Governance research group at McGill, where he leads a team of researchers investigating pressing urban governance problems related to economic development, environmental sustainability, and housing markets. He is the co-lead of the Adapting Urban Environments for the Future theme of the McGill Sustainability Systems Initiative, where he is part of a broad interdisciplinary team developing new ways of conceptualizing, measuring, and improving urban sustainability. A major focus of his work has been explaining a transition in policy and planning from identifying the city as a global sustainability problem to identifying the city as a solution to global sustainability problems. He is one of the world’s leading experts on the impacts of short-term rental platforms such as Airbnb on cities around the world, and consults widely with municipalities and community organizations on designing appropriate regulations. Dr. Wachsmuth has published widely in top journals in urban studies, planning and geography, and his work has been covered extensively in the national and international media, including the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Associated Press, and the Washington Post. He is the Early Career Editor of the journal <i>Territory, Politics, Governance</i> and serves on the editorial boards of the journal <i>Urban Geography</i>."}

```{r robin_basalaev_binder,  fig.cap="<strong><big><a href = '' target='_blank'>Robin Basalaev-Binder</a></big></strong><br>Robin completed her Master of Urban Planning in 2018 at McGill University. Her passion for social and racial justice, equity, as well as affordable and accessible housing has led her to pursue research centered on these issues. Her sustainability research focuses on access and equity in Canada, and the disparities present in Smart Cities approaches. She has also conducted studies exploring gentrification, urban resilience, short-term rentals in the housing system, and the intersection of immigration and housing. Robin is particularly interested in how communities marginalized by the system and individuals with vulnerable immigration status can participate in urban planning processes and advocacy. Her work focuses on the US, Canadian, and Latin American contexts. She plans to continue her research as a doctoral student in Urban Planning in 2021."}

He received his Master of Urban Planning from the Texas A&M University. Qiao Zhao’s research focuses on the relationship between the built environment and travel behavior with a particular emphasis on bicycle equity. His work recognizes that cycling facilities – along with the accessibility and social gains that they can provide – are inequitably distributed across communities of varying socio-demographic composition. To explore the implications of this distribution for bicycle equity, Qiao’s dissertation investigates the current bicycle network’s equity performance, the potential impacts of cycling investment on travel behaviors among disadvantaged populations, and the equity implications of crowdsourced data to drive bicycle network planning decisions."}
