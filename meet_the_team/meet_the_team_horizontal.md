He received his Master of Urban Planning from the Texas A&amp;M University. Qiao Zhao’s research focuses on the relationship between the built environment and travel behavior with a particular emphasis on bicycle equity. His work recognizes that cycling facilities – along with the accessibility and social gains that they can provide – are inequitably distributed across communities of varying socio-demographic composition. To explore the implications of this distribution for bicycle equity, Qiao’s dissertation investigates the current bicycle network’s equity performance, the potential impacts of cycling investment on travel behaviors among disadvantaged populations, and the equity implications of crowdsourced data to drive bicycle network planning decisions." width="2172" />
