                    justice and is
                    interested in understanding and addressing the inequities involved in both the transport planning

                    Canada.
                    His main research interests are: 1) biodiversity loss as a form of global change, 2) species
                    persistence
                    in
                    fluctuating and changing environments, and 3) the links between biodiversity change, sustainability

                    qualitative
                    methods in active transport planning and the importance of embodied knowledge through walking. She
                    also
