<h2>PMD (Coderre administration):</h2>
<p>Heavily reliant on the mobilization of the local business community. The plan attempts to engage for-profit and nonprofit companies by calling on them to take on one or more of 20 environmental actions suggested in its partner organization action plan. The plan was elaborated in partnership with a large number of these organizations, which include major nonprofits, multinational corporations, local businesses, local citizen and environmental groups, local nonprofits and co-ops. Neither the PMD nor the Plan d’adaptation aux changements climatiques are particularly focused on engaging the community at large though some local implementation is made possible through projects organized on the (now seemingly defunct) Faire Montreal platform. Therefore, while the PMD, and to a lesser extent, the Plan d’adaptation aux changements climatiques, contain calls to action directed at the community, residents are seldom engaged, and are to be communicated to through programs of awareness raising.</p>

<div id="plan-climat-plante-administration" class="section level2">
<h2>Plan climat (Plante administration):</h2>
<p>The Plan climat is a vocally community-focused plan stressing shared responsibility in responding to climate change. It favours public consultation, the growth of social capital among the population and the emergence of community-based climate resiliency through collaboration with actors on the ground. The general public are described as ‘stakeholders’, and are assigned significant agency in taking action against climate change through their actions as a community, but also their decisions as individuals. The plan’s outreach components still include ‘awareness-raising’ targeted at the public who, as the plan states, need an example to follow and towards ‘vulnerable groups’ who must be made fully aware of the benefits of an ecological transition. The elaboration of the plan relied on a climate advisory committee made up of 19 members from the nonprofit sector, the private sector and academia. This committee was to serve as a liaison to the community, building the plan’s content to meet the community’s expectations. A committee of experts from private industry, academia and the NGO world deciding on plan content is a major departure from the city’s previous climate change plans, which were designed by the municipal government, with some consultation from the private sector and civil society.</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The PMD and the Plan climat both state their interest in mobilizing the community and stakeholders around the issue of climate change, underscoring the importance of solidarity, cooperation and awareness, but their approaches differ. The PMD aims to spur action on the part of citizens and organizations by providing platforms for undertaking sustainability projects at the local level and for motivating businesses and nonprofits to modify their practices - a stakeholder-driven engagement plan. The Plan climat makes more of an effort at outreach and grassroots organization, looking to partner with actors within communities in order to grow local autonomy and social capital. Its preference for public consultation may offer more opportunities for agency on the part of local actors and communities, depending on the format of each consultation process. It is noteworthy that the drafting of each plan reflects a process of participation and consultation, particularly with stakeholders that each administration deemed worthwhile to bring to the table, and in this respect the plans are quite different. For the PMD, the Coderre administration continued to build on the network of climate planning stakeholders from the Gérald Tremblay administration, growing the number of organizations consulted on the plan. The PMD consulted with groups in local government (at the municipal and the borough level), private industry, co-ops, pension funds, grassroots community groups and many others. The circle of groups with influence on the Plan climat’s content is a great deal smaller. The Plante administration’s climate advisory committee represents a major down-scaling of the number of groups involved in a climate plan’s elaboration, and presents a narrower aperture of participation by limiting itself to persons and organizations from private enterprise, the nonprofit space and academia.</p>
