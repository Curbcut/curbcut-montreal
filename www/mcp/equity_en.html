<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>Equity concerns have become an ever greater part of the practice of climate planning over time, and Montreal’s climate plans are not exceptions to this trend. Both plans are vocally committed to equity and solidarity, and both promise to make the city fairer and more inclusive. It could be expected that the Plan climat, drafted under the community-oriented Valérie Plante administration, would feature a stronger commitment to equitable development, and this generally holds true. Besides doubling the city’s contribution to universal accessibility (a laudable decision to be sure), the PMD has nothing material to deliver in terms of equity. It focuses on plans for the young, plans for the old, the efficiency of service provision, and social integration through outreach and employment. The Plan climat, in an odd twist, does better at building from the Coderre administration’s PACCAM than the Coderre administration did, using its vulnerability analyses to target its interventions and find areas of greatest need, though no specific interventions are proposed.</p>
<p>While the Plan climat contains more equity policy proposals and is probably more well-rounded, both plans have blind spots. While the PMD does little to address housing, the Plan climat has absolutely nothing to say about addressing homelessness, with the homeless being arguably the single most vulnerable group to climate hazards.</p>
