<h2>PMD (Coderre administration):</h2>
<p>The city will make itself an example of sustainable development both nationally and on the world stage by undertaking marquee projects such as the Université de Montréal MIL campus and by hosting major international sustainability events. It will also tie itself to sustainable development and Fair Trade networks, both within Canada and internationally. The plan also presents a desire , unfulfilled it seems, to build a provincial network of municipalities to facilitate the exchange of ideas on sustainable development.</p>
<p>##Plan climat (Plante administration):</p>
<p>The Plan climat underlines Montreal’s various international commitments under the Paris Accord and the One Planet Charter. The city’s emissions goals are in line with commitments made at the Climate Action Summit. The plan was also created in part by the office of ecological transition and resilience, born from the Rockefeller Foundation’s 100 Resilient Cities program, which Montreal joined in 2016. This transnational network appears to have had significant influence on the Plan climat, particularly in terms of framing and language. Commitments to an outward-facing internationalism are cut back on in this plan as the focus shifts to the city as exemplary to its citizens, instead of as internationally exemplary.</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The PMD is invested in making Montreal an outward-facing, international city for sustainability; not only as a case study or blueprint, but as a hub and host city bringing together businesses, governments and experts in the world of sustainability. The Plan climat, on the other hand, is more focused on the city not as an international example, but as an example to its constituents and stakeholders. This does not mean, however, that this plan is any less entrenched in international systems and agreements, or the framework of global city competition. The Plan climat’s objectives and policies are openly influenced by Montreal’s membership the Paris agreement, the One Planet Charter and C40. Parts of its content, as well as some of the plan’s writers, originate from Montreal’s involvement in the 100 Resilient Cities project. The PMD and the Plan climat approach international and regional networks and agreements differently. Coderre’s vision in the PMD could be described as bolder, promising to branch out, join new agreements, and give Montreal a place on the world stage. Plante’s Plan climat has an international vision based on honouring agreements and building off of the infrastructure that was put in place by networks that the city is already a member of.</p>
