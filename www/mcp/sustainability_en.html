<h2>PMD (Coderre administration):</h2>
<div id="building" class="section level4">
<h4>Building</h4>
<p>Reach 70 municipal buildings with LEED or BOMA BEST certification. Reduce the energy use of municipal buildings by 5%. Ensure that 75% of subsidies to companies for building construction, expansion, or renovation comply with environmental criteria.</p>
</div>
<div id="governance" class="section level4">
<h4>Governance</h4>
<p>Improve Montreal’s socially responsible supply policies. Draw a portrait of Montreal’s fossil fuel investment and investigate opportunities for divestment.</p>
</div>
<div id="services" class="section level4">
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>A 20% reduction in the potable water produced by Montreal’s treatment plans compared to 2011. Maintain a renewal rate of aqueducts above 1%. Install a disinfection station at the water filtration plant. Construct a tunnel to protect the Atwater filtration plant’s inflow pipe from damage resulting from automobile traffic. Correct 275 cross-connections. Build retention ponds for an added capacity of 130,000 cubic metres. Implement the city’s water management plan. Extend composting services to 100% of buildings with 8 or fewer dwellings. Extend waste, recycling and compost collection in high traffic areas and to municipal public buildings.</p>
</div>

<div id="plan-climat-plante-administration" class="section level2">
<h2>Plan climat (Plante administration):</h2>
<div id="building-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Building</h4>
<p>Improve the energy efficiency of buildings through the implementation of a grading and reporting system (for private buildings) beginning with major commercial and institutional buildings. Ban the use of fossil fuels in all municipal buildings, which will be powered by renewable energy exclusively. Create new norms for the energy efficiency and emissions of municipal buildings. Control of emissions coming from the cooling of public buildings. Incentivize a shift away from fuel oil heating for commercial and residential buildings.</p>
</div>
<div id="governance-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Governance</h4>
<p>Produce a thorough inventory of GHG emissions from the Montreal community’s consumer habits. Implement measures to allow the city to achieve its waste management goals, including eliminating single-use plastics, donation and reuse of textiles and mobilizing the community. Create a “climate test” that will serve to evaluate the impact of all city decisions. Rolled out over three years, the test will initially apply to major projects such as infrastructure, and then eventually to all decisions. Establish a “carbon budget” for the Montreal community, based on benchmarks established by the C40. Addition of a chapter on the climate into the city’s annual budget. Create a working plan to reduce emissions from construction sites. Create a downtown zero-emission zone by 2030. Funding for owners of private residential buildings to undertake sustainability/efficiency retrofits.</p>
</div>
<div id="services-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Services</h4>
<p>Enable donation and reuse of textiles (textiles account for 4% of emissions for the world’s large cities). Replace the aging incinerators at the Jean-R.-Marcotte water filtration plant. Install filters to capture the methane produced by the Complexe environnemental Saint-Michel.</p>

<div id="discussion" class="section level2">
<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>The greatest differences between the PMD and the Plan climat in terms of their sustainable development policies are the PMD’s emphasis on services (water in particular), and the Plan climat’s emphasis on reforming the Montreal’s governace in a sustainable direction. Indeed, many of the most interesting policies proposed in the Plan climat are oriented towards governance and, depending on their implementation, could bring real change. Building policies are incremental, in a sense, particularly in how they act on municipal assets. First improving the efficiency of municipal buildings and attaining certifications in the PMD, and then banning fossil fuel use in those buildings and implementing new norms for energy efficiency and cooling in the Plan climat. The Plan climat’s regulations on construction and programs to regulate and subsidize the energy-efficiency of buildings could be highly effective emissions-reducing policies if new bylaws are indeed proposed and approved, and the funding program can get off the ground. In a city where 28% of total emissions come from buildings (residential, commercial and institutional), tighter regulations for energy efficiency and clean construction will go a long way. As is the case for many policies in the PMD and the Plan climat, details are hard to come by, particularly for the more sweeping governance measures. The PMD does not define its responsible supply policies, not its promise to investigate fossil fuel divestment. The Plan climat does little to explain the parameters of its carbon budget and its climate test for municipal decisions.</p>
