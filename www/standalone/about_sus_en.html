<p>Curbcut is a platform for exploring urban sustainability in the
Montreal region across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Curbcut
offers a justice- and inclusivity-focused approach to sustainability
which integrates the widest possible range of data sources to help
researchers, policymakers, communities, and individuals.</p>
<p>Urban sustainability is a complex, multidimensional concept
encompassing a variety of stakeholders, values and priorities. The
governance and planning of cities must balance competing voices and
visions over multiple spatial and temporal scales, from federal and
provincial policy to decisions that businesses, firms, and institutions
make, down to the level of households and individuals. Curbcut embraces
an inclusive vision of urban sustainability, allowing users to pose
questions about environmental issues and contextualize them within
larger frameworks of equity and accessibility. It serves as both a
data-exploration tool and a knowledge and information-sharing resource,
designed to encourage greater reflection on urban sustainability
challenges, and on the communities which are most affected by them.</p>
<p>Curbcut stands at the intersection of two ongoing transformations of
urban life, urban governance, and urban research. First, cities are
increasingly understood as key arenas for determining the planet’s
environmental trajectory, and academic, policy, and public interest in
urban sustainability has risen accordingly (Angelo and Wachsmuth 2020).
Second, as part of a trend towards data-driven governance, cities are
becoming increasingly prominent laboratories for “smart city”
initiatives which incorporate digital technologies into local decision
making and indeed the physical fabric of the city (Greenfield 2006;
Mattern 2015).</p>
<p>Curbcut further mobilizes objective data and quantitative analysis
within an understanding of the injustices and disparities in urban life.
Each module within Curbcut encourages a critical lens toward inequity in
cities, and the danger that the move towards sustainable urbanism could
have problematic implications in terms of exclusion, displacement, and
affordability.</p>
<p>Curbcut catalyzes new understandings of urban sustainability,
transforms conventional thinking about the relationship between humans
and the natural environment in cities, and aims to positively shift the
trajectory of local sustainability decision making across Canada.</p>
