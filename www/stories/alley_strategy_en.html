<h3>The Context of the green alleys</h3>
<p>
Alleys have been part of the urban morphology of Montreal since the
1800s when they were conceived as narrow streets to access some
dwellings and courtyards. As of 1890, back alleys became widespread in
the city’s configuration in boroughs like Le Plateau Mont-Royal,
Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie, Villeray, Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, and
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (Centre d’histoire de Montréal). However, around
1950, alleys were eliminated as part of the city’s morphology in the new
neighbourhoods. Furthermore, the use of the alleys changed as they
became dark service streets, mainly unused, filthy and, in some areas,
dangerous due to the lack of light and activity.
</p>
<p>
However, in 1980 the alleys experienced a revitalization process thanks
to two complementary programs: “Opération Tournesol,” a subsidy program
for demolishing sheds in backyards, and the “Place au Soleil” program
that transformed 58 back alleys into small parks.
<p/>
<p>
The main feature of the “Place au Soleil” program was the recovery of
the alleys by creating a linear park with trees and shrubs while leaving
it accessible to car users when they needed it. The principle of the
linear park was to transform alleys into pedestrian spaces. Therefore,
the pedestrian vocation of these public areas was clearly defined,
eliminating car traffic in the back alleys. Furthermore, this program
redesigned the alleys to become a new green space to solve the lack of
park space in some of Montreal’s densely populated neighbourhoods.
Consequently, “Opération Tournesol” and “Place au Soleil” generated
public interest (Taquin and Waltz, 1982). The redevelopment of the
alleys created a change of vision of the back alleys as unsafe and dirty
places. However, despite the effort to revitalize alleys, the programs
were abandoned in 1988 because of insufficient funds.
</p>
<p>
In 1995, a new proposal for enhancing alleys emerged with the creation
of the first green alley in Plateau-Mont-Royal, located in Napoleon,
Roy, Parc La Fontaine and Mentana streets.
</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>
The current Green Alley Program appeared due to the citizens’ motivation
for redeveloping alleys as public green spaces (Bur et al., 2007). The
enthusiasm for green alleys was encouraged by the creation of the
Éco-quartiers, also in 1995, whose mission is to provide environmental
education and support citizens in their greening initiatives (Ville de
Montréal, 2020).
</p>
<p>
The Green Alley Program is a bottom-up approach that promotes public
participation and citizen governance. The boroughs and Éco-quartiers
manage the Program, which was conceived to support the citizens’
initiative to enhance back alleys and add greenery. Consequently, the
Program aims to provide environmental and well-being benefits by
encouraging the reduction of the heat island effect and pollution,
increasing biodiversity, and improving water management by including
vegetation.
</p>
<p>
Today, 13 of the 19 boroughs of the city have implemented the Green
Alley Program, and there are around 578 green alleys in 11 boroughs as
part of the strategy to reduce some of the adverse effects of the
climate emergency and to expand green space through the neighbourhoods.

<h3>Green alleys as a climate emergency adaptation</h3>
<p>
Back alleys represent one of the main features of Montreal’s spatial
configuration since they define the morphology of many neighbourhoods in
the different boroughs. Alleys form a network of primarily underused
public spaces that represent an opportunity to be transformed into green
alleys to incorporate vegetation and experience a calm and diverse
environment in flora, fauna, and activities, far from the noise of main
avenues and congested city areas. Moreover, everyone can enjoy these
benefits without leaving the neighbourhood, demonstrating the potential
of adapting alleys by including vegetation in an already existing public
infrastructure.
<p/>
<p>
Green alleys can generate more than just local benefits. They can also
become part of a city’s strategy to adapt the built environment to
diverse climate change effects by allocating green infrastructure and
repurposing their use. Transforming back alleys into green alleys
implies rearranging the space so they become quality public spaces for
people instead of secondary streets for vehicular traffic.
<p/>
<p>
Indeed, green alleys can mitigate the heat island effect produced by the
paved surfaces by reassigning space for planting vegetation, adding
permeable surfaces, and reducing or eliminating car transit to favour
walkability and other active modes of transport. Furthermore, green
alleys can improve water management and air quality with diverse
vegetation types.
<p/>
<p>
These transformations have been implemented in boroughs like
Plateau-Mont-Royal, Sainte-Marie in Ville-Marie, Rosemont, Sud-Ouest,
Verdun, and Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, where some of the alley
entrances are closed to car circulation and transformed with green
surfaces, gardens, and trees. These rearrangements represent a
significant change in the usage of alleys since greenery enhances the
quality of these public spaces, generating an active and safe use due to
the limited or restricted car transit.
<p/>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="stories/visuals/alley_strategy/figure3.jpeg" alt="Sud-Ouest (Left), Plateau-Mont-Royal (Center), Maisonneuve (Right)." width="500" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>
Most green alleys improve the thermal comfort of pedestrians due to the
trees and walls with vegetation that provide shade and make the alleys
cooler than regular streets. Furthermore, several new alleys are adding
permeable surfaces with grass or vegetation. Therefore, these
transformations reduce the urban heat island effect.
<p/>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="stories/visuals/alley_strategy/figure4.jpeg" alt="Alleys with diverse greenery" width="500" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>
Permeable surfaces with greenery are essential to contribute to water
management. Particularly considering the adverse changes that the
climate emergency is provoking, where heat waves and rain periods are
intensifying (Vibert and Rouillé, 2018). Therefore, the alleys could
contribute to a greater extent to the city’s resilience by reducing the
paved surfaces with diverse green infrastructure types to mitigate
extreme weather conditions.
<p/>
<p>
When alleys rely only on the environmental benefits of trees in private
courtyards adjacent to the alley, they cannot reduce flood events, as
illustrated in the following photo taken in June 2022.
<p/>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

</p>
</div>
<p>
In contrast, green alleys with porous surfaces can control rainwater due
to the permeable surface and the vegetation. Some examples of these
interventions are Ruelle Verte Larivière in Sainte-Marie, and a new
alley in Plateau-Mont-Royal part of a public space called “Water Square”
(Place des Fleurs-de-Macadam). The latter is part of a multi-purpose
square with retention ponds designed to capture rainwater. This feature
will “allow up to 30 cm of water to be drained into the soil in less
than 48 hours” (Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, 2021).

<h3>New initiatives toward climate change: Ruelles Bleues Vertes</h3>
<p>
In 2017, a new initiative emerged considering green alleys an
opportunity to improve rainwater management: “Ruelles bleues vertes.”
This project is led by the Alliance Ruelles bleues-vertes, a partnership
of public and private actors that involves citizens and city
authorities, aiming to test sustainable rainwater management solutions
to cope with climate change.
<p/>
<p>
The project will start with the construction of two alleys, Ruelle
Turquoise in Mercier-Hochelaga-Maisonneuve
(Viau/Ontario/Saint-Clément/Roue) and the Ruelle Bleue Verte in
Pointe-Saint-Charles, next to “Bâtiment 7”.
<p/>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="stories/visuals/alley_strategy/figure7.jpeg" alt="Image from www.ruellesbleuesvertes.com/le-processus/projets-pilotes" width="960" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>
This initiative is based on the same principle of the green alleys:
community engagement. Therefore, the neighbours are vital actors in
transforming the green-blue alleys, and the development is according to
their expectations and needs. However, green-blue alleys seek to include
more extensive infrastructure to manage rainwater with water retention
mechanisms and infiltration with permeable surfaces and rain gardens to
reduce the volume of water that goes to the sewer. Water management
serves to mitigate floods but also to reduce polluting discharges into
waterways. Moreover, the green infrastructure is considered the main
element to decrease the heat island effect and increase urban
biodiversity as it occurs in a green alley project. Additionally, the
blue-green alley projects were conceived as a strategy to promote public
spaces where citizens are involved in developing and maintaining their
living environment.
<p/>
<p>
Given that blue-green alleys require significant infrastructural
transformations, the two projects have a partnership of diverse actors.
Some of them are the city of Montreal, the boroughs, the Éco-quartiers,
several universities, Conseil Régional Environnement Montréal, and
Action-Gardien in Pointe-Saint-Charles, La Table de Quartier
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and 7 À NOUS, administrator of “Bâtiment 7”.
Furthermore, the blue-green alley official website indicates that the
“Green Fund” funds the project as part of Action-Climat Québec. It was
possible “thanks to the contribution of the Fonds d’action québécois
pour le développement durable (FAQDD) and its financial partner, the
Government of Quebec.”
<p/>

<h3>La ruelle Turquoise</h3>
<p>
The Turquoise blue-green alley has been an ongoing project since 2017,
located in Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. The aim is to link the alley with the
Antenne Longue-Pointe green public area. The vision for the project is
to create ponds that will collect rainwater and then absorb it into the
soil.
<p/>
<p>
According to the website, the project will count 900 m² of permeable
surface, 1680 m² of vegetation and the potential to divert 9600 m² of
stormwater from sewers, equivalent to 2.6 Olympic pools.

<h3>Ruelle bleue-verte in Pointe-Saint-Charles</h3>
<p>
The construction of the alley, located between Le Ber and
Sainte-Madeleine streets, will begin in spring 2022. The project
represents an opportunity to highlight the importance of water
management through a citizen participation process where different
actors intervene to enhance the quality of urban environments from the
environmental, social, and economic perspectives.
<p/>
<p>
The blue-green alley will be a pedestrian green space between “Bâtiment
7”, and two new parks designed with the participation of citizens. The
alley will be linked to an urban agriculture project. It will have
Bioretention areas that use rain gardens to collect the rainwater from
the adjacent buildings and a public space that increases urban greening
and biodiversity.
<p/>
<p><img src="stories/visuals/alley_strategy/figure9.jpg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>
Overall, adapting alleys demonstrates the positive impact that proposals
from the community can generate in repurposing unused urban spaces.
Therefore, adapting alleys to improve people’s quality of life on a
neighbourhood scale can simultaneously enhance urban quality on a larger
scale, considering the growth that the green alleys initiative has
experienced in the last years and the emergence of proposals derived
from the green alleys like the Blue-Green Alleys.
<p/>
<p>
Consequently, the Green Alley Program and the Blue-Green Alleys can be
part of the city’s strategy to mitigate adverse climate change effects
by increasing green infrastructure and, with it, the opportunity to be
in contact with nature and improve climate conditions.
