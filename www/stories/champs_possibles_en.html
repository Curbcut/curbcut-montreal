<p>Located in the Mile End neighbourhood along the Canadian Pacific
Railroad tracks and delimited by the Carmelites Monastery on the east
and old garment factories on the west, the Champ des Possibles is a
unique local green space. What is now a protected urban prairie, the
Champ des Possibles has had an interesting history that has recently led
to its protected status and a unique co-management governance structure
between a community-led non-profit organization, Les Amis du Champ des
Possible, and the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough. Different from other parks
nearby, the name of this space, the “Field of Possibilities” in English,
suits it well with the wide array of uses and appropriations that take
place. For those who frequent and take care of the Champ des Possibles,
it has become an important place to demonstrate how a community can be
involved in the official management of a park-like space. It is known
for its characteristics of being “wild” and “natural”, but this has not
always been the case. The Champ des Possibles has transformed throughout
the last 150 years from a quarry to a landfill, to a rail yard, to
gradually becoming the space it is today (Desjardins, 2019).
Simultaneously, the surrounding area of the Mile End has undergone many
changes and has experienced heavy gentrification. In its trajectory to
becoming the popular area it is today, it has transformed from a stop on
the rail line, to Montreal’s garment district, to a hub for tech
companies (Desjardins, 2019; McSwiney &amp; Michaud, 2014). Both the
physical and social changes throughout the decades have shaped the
current reality of the neighbourhood and its spaces such as the Champ
des Possibles. The story of the Champ des Possibles and its current
co-management governance structure, which emphasizes community-led
decision-making, exemplifies how spontaneity and looseness can be
positive in the context of urban planning for both policy and
design.</p>

<p>During the 1850’s the land where the Champ des Possibles is currently
located had several quarries. At this time the area was still rural, and
by the end of the 19th century the quarries had become abandoned
(Desjardins, 2019). Some were simply left untended and became dangerous,
while others were turned into dumping grounds, such as the Champ des
Possibles (Desjardins, 2019). Eventually, in the early 1900’s, the dump
was filled and in 1906 the Canadian Pacific Railway purchased the land
and used it as a rail yard to store its cars. Between 1950 and 1975,
large textile factories were built in the area and some of these
megastructures that housed these factories are still around today
(McSwiney &amp; Michaud, 2014). With the presence of the textile
industry and the rail yard, workers and services came into the area and
the Mile End quickly transformed into an urban hub (McSwiney &amp;
Michaud, 2014). The rail yard closed in the mid-1980’s and the field was
left to grow freely and with this spontaneous rewilding process gained
great biodiversity (McSwiney &amp; Michaud, 2014). This was due to its
location where seeds were being brought in by the nearby trains and
people sowing seeds and planting vegetation themselves (McSwiney &amp;
Michaud, 2014). Since the space was left essentially untouched until
recently, there are still physical signs of the space’s history: the
buildings along de Gaspé Ave. are curved to accommodate past train
lines, there are crumbling loading docks, and buried train tracks
(McSwiney &amp; Michaud, 2014).</p>
<p>The Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) officially owned the land until
2005 when the Plateau-Mont-Royal borough took ownership (Poteete et al.,
2021). At first, the city was going to use the lot as a service yard,
but soon many proposals were made for the area (Beaudin, 2013). With the
borough’s acquisition of the lot in the early 2000’s, there was
increased interest in the development potential of the area. Many
studies were carried out to determine how to develop the Saint-Viateur
East Sector, which is delimited by Saint Denis Street, Saint Laurent
Street, Maguire Street, and the railway. Initially the priority of the
development plan was to increase vehicular accessibility and
connectivity to the area (Desjardins, 2021). It was proposed to connect
Saint-Viateur Avenue to Henri-Julien Street by building a road
connecting the two, where there is now a pedestrian and cycling way.
Carmel Avenue was also to be extended to Alma Street to create a new
connection behind the buildings along de Gaspé Avenue (Desjardins,
2021). In addition to these new roads, the proposal included the
expropriation and demolition of buildings like 5555 de Gaspé Avenue,
which housed many artists’ studios and was a defining feature of the
neighbourhood at the time (Desjardins, 2021). Residential buildings were
also to be built in the area and on the site of the Champ des Possibles.
Many factors led to these proposals never being realized.</p>
<p>In 2005, following citizen mobilization, the nearby Carmelite
monastery was deemed a historical monument by the Ministry of Culture
(Desjardin, 2021). This resulted in the area, including the adjacent
Champ des Possibles, becoming protected and several building constraints
being implemented. There are height restrictions for any new buildings
in the area and tranquility is an explicit objective (Desjardins, 2021).
Two major documented actions specifically challenged the development of
the field: the Roerich Garden Project, and the Sprout Out Loud (McSwiney
&amp; Michaud, 2014). The Roerich Garden Project was created in 2007 to
“provoke dialogue about the many ways the community used and interacted
with the field” (McSwiney &amp; Michaud, 2014, pp. 272). This project
was initiated in the Champ des Possibles, at the time known as the
Maguire Meadow or le champ, by Emily Rose Michaud (Michaud, n.d.). The
garden was a 312-square foot Roerich symbol made up of living materials
and was maintained for three years by Sprout Out Loud, a community
group. The Roerich symbol was created and used to protect historical,
cultural, and scientific monuments during World War II from aerial
bombings (McSwiney &amp; Michaud, 2014). Building a living garden in the
shape of this symbol was a way to challenge and reflect on the uses and
potential development of the Champ des Possibles (Michaud, n.d.). The
project led to citizens gathering and better defining what they wanted
for the space and critically reflecting on the city’s development plans
(Michaud, n.d.).</p>

<p>In 2008, the city announced it would begin to develop the
Saint-Viateur East sector, and another initiative subsequently followed
to formally protect the space. Another community group, the Mile End
Citizen’s Committee, had a citizen’s forum that addressed the city’s
upcoming plans for the $9 million development of the Mile End
neighbourhood (McSwiney &amp; Michaud, 2014). Following this forum,
community resistance for the city’s redevelopment of the Champ des
Possibles was reinforced. At the same time there was a change in
government at the municipal level. In 2009, Projet Montréal swept the
borough council winning all seats which would contribute to the
municipal administration’s decisions regarding the Champ des Possibles
and broader Saint-Viateur East Sector (Desjardins, 2021). The actions
taken in the Champ des Possibles in combination with the reaction from
the broader neighbourhood community and change in political leadership
were a catalyst for proposing alternative plans (McSwiney &amp; Michaud,
2014). The Mile End Citizens’ Committee mobilized a subcommittee to
develop and propose options that would better represent and serve the
locals (McSwiney &amp; Michaud, 2014). Eventually, Les Amis du Champ des
Possibles was created out of this effort with the objective to
collaborate with the borough and municipality to advocate for the local
community’s concerns (McSwiney &amp; Michaud, 2014).</p>
<p>Les Amis du Champ des Possibles (ACDP) was officially formed in 2010
as a non-profit organization with three main aims:</p>
<blockquote>
<q>to make the Champ des Possibles a permanent public green space and
urban biodiversity reserve; promote and encourage public education on
natural science, history, and art; promote the creation of new urban
green spaces and biodiversity corridors.</q> (Poteete et al., 2021)
</blockquote>
<p>Since 2013, ACDP has had a formal co-management agreement with the
Plateau-Mont-Royal borough. In May of the same year the site became
formally recognized as a natural green space. The co-management
agreement came into place simultaneously with the borough’s new
redevelopment plan for Saint-Viateur East. The objectives of this plan
were to: establish conditions that are more favourable to artists and to
the creative and tech industries; review the use of the first floors to
promote animation of the area; formalize the creation of a park; and to
protect the heritage integrity of the Carmelite Monastery
(Plateau-Mont-Royal, 2013). This led to the existing pedestrian and
cycling way that connects de Gaspé Avenue and Henri-Julien Street in the
Champ des Possibles.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The first co-management agreement between ACDP and the
Plateau-Mont-Royal borough was for four years, a revised version was put
into place in 2017 and expired in 2019 and has since been renewed.
During 2020 a research partnership project entitled <em>Supporting the
Possibilities of Urban Commoning in Montréal’s Champ des Possibles</em>
began between ACDP, Prof. Amy Poteete from Concordia University and
Prof. Nik Luka from McGill University. The aim of this project has been
to co-produce knowledge about the uses of, interests in, and future
aspirations for the Champ des Possibles. This project is still currently
underway and has a multidisciplinary team employing various research
methods such as direct observations, participatory observations, focus
groups, interviews, and questionnaires. Although the co-management
structure has so far resulted in a non-interventionist approach to the
development of the Champ des Possibles, there is a plan in place to
decontaminate the site which is set to start between 2022-2023. In
combination with the rapid gentrification of the surrounding
neighbourhoods, and attractiveness of the site to those with financial
interests, the partners of the <em>Supporting the Possibilities of Urban
Commoning in Montréal’s Champ des Possibles</em> project are concerned
with developing ways to help ensure commoning practices can continue and
community voices remain an important part of the development
process.</p>
<p>Community involvement is part of what makes the Champ des Possibles a
unique local green space. Not only is this apparent in how the Champ des
Possibles came to be an official protected green space, or its ongoing
co-management governance structure, but also in how it is being used and
users’ aspirations. In 2021 the <em>Supporting the Possibilities of
Urban Commoning in Montréal’s Champ des Possibles</em> project published
its first report which outlines interesting findings related to the
activities that take place in the Champ des Possibles and peoples’
wishes for the future of the space and its management. One of the
interests of the researchers was to examine care and stewardship of the
Champ des Possibles. Poteete et al. (2021) found that the most common
and frequent activity was the disposal of garbage, while other
activities included the removal of physical barriers to the site and
maintenance of paths and other features of the site.</p>
<p>The removal of physical barriers to the site is an ongoing issue in
the Champ des Possibles, particularly the cutting of holes in the fence
alongside the railway as shown in the photo below. Since 2011, the
Plateau-Mont-Royal borough has been in negotiations with Canadian
Pacific Rail and Transport Canada regarding the construction of a level
crossing that would allow pedestrians and cyclists to safely travel over
the train tracks (Norris, 2019). The informal pathways that are
continuously upheld by citizens are a clear indication of the need to
safely connect the Champ des Possibles, and the Mile End, to Rosemont
(Norris, 2019). As of 2019, Montreal’s case for a level-crossing was
still under examination by a Transport Canada tribunal (Norris, 2019).
In 2022, the debate arose again after a fatal accident happened at the
Van Horne Street and Saint-Laurent Street informal crossing (Samson,
2022). Following the accident, railway police reportedly began giving
$650 fines to individuals crossing the tracks and residents of the area
expressed their frustration with the ongoing situation (Samson, 2022).
The sentiment felt by many residents is that the alternative pathways
are inconvenient, adding approximately 20-30 minutes of travel time, and
are unpleasant for pedestrians (Samson, 2022). Some individuals in
Poteete et al.’s (2021) study perceive upholding these informal
crossings as one way to care or participate in the stewardship of the
Champ des Possibles.</p>

</div>
<p>Within the theme of care and stewardship, respondents were also asked
about their desired management strategy related to the vegetation of the
Champ des Possibles. Poteete et al.’s (2021) findings indicate that the
least desired strategy is a conventional one with lawns and decorative
greenery, where respondents understood the current stewardship of the
Champ des Possibles as allowing it to grow freely and as a rejection of
the typical landscaping of urban parks. It is precisely this type of
“wildness”, both in terms of greenery and its communitarian orientation,
that is important and exemplary for many of its visitors (Poteete et
al., 2021).</p>
<p>For many of the respondents of Poteete et al.’s (2021) research,
access to green space such as the Champ des Possibles where individuals
can closely interact with various types of vegetation, small animals and
insects is undervalued in an urban context. Biodiversity and the
“natural” features of the Champ des Possibles are emphasized, where for
many the space provides a reprieve and positive contrast to its
surrounding large buildings (Poteete et al., 2021). The “wildness” of
the Champ des Possibles is where one of its paradoxes lie; for some it
represents what they love most about the space whereas for others it
represents unstructured management. A non-interventionist approach that
allows for the Champ des Possibles’ biodiversity and “natural” green
space also leaves room for behaviours that damages the space such as
“littering and illegal dumping, lighting campfires, making noise, and
destroying some plants” (Poteete et al., 2021, p. 13). For now, the
Champ des Possibles accommodates this paradox and allows for both
realities to co-exist. Of course, the concerns are if and for how long
the Champ des Possibles will be able to continue as this type of liminal
green space, delicately balancing this paradox.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: left">
<img src="stories/visuals/champs_possibles/Image5_IMG_0670.jpeg" alt="Image 5.A Fire Pit and Art Installation in the Champ des Possibles" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Its historical trajectory illustrates how community involvement is an
important part of the Champ des Possibles’ identity and current
co-management governance structure. With the forthcoming decontamination
plan of the site, there will be inevitable physical changes. Poteete et
al.’s (2021) research points to the importance of this space and its
biodiversity to its community and the broader surrounding areas. The
management and development of the Champ des Possibles that has taken
place over the last decade showcases the complexity as well as the
advantages of a non-interventionist approach both for policy and design.
Having a co-management agreement between ACDP and the Plateau-Mont-Royal
borough has ensured that community voices are part of the management and
development processes. Because of this, the Champ des Possibles has not
become like other urban parks and has mostly remained “wild” and
“natural”. The lack of manicured design is precisely what many enjoy
about this green space and wish for it to continue (Poteete et al.,
2021). This looseness allows for spontaneity and appropriation which can
have both positive and negative outcomes, manifesting in many ways such
as care through garbage removal or making bonfires which can be harmful
(Poteete et al., 2021). The cooperation between grassroots organizations
and eventually the borough has resulted in a space that is less
structured both physically and socially. This has led to vegetation
growing more liberally and for a multitude of behaviours and activities
to take place in the Champ des Possibles. Green spaces such as this are
rare, and the Champ des Possibles can serve as an example for the
benefits of merging bottom-up and top-down approaches to urban
planning.</p>
