class="section level3">
<h3>The age of the automobile: early cycling difficulties in
Montreal</h3>
<p>In the 1970s, cycling as a mode of transport was almost non-existent
in Montreal. City streets were prioritised for automobiles at the
expense of pedestrians and cyclists, creating dangerous conditions for
active transport modes. A lack of cycling infrastructure proved to be
deadly for the few cyclists who braved the streets. Automobiles killed
an average of 68 cyclists per year in Montreal from 1966 to 1976,
including 86 cycling deaths in just 1974 (Scott, 2022). Unfavourable
legislation posed an additional burden to potential cyclists, who were
often restricted from popular destinations, such as the Botanical
Gardens and Île-Ste-Hélène (Noakes, 2022). Furthermore, an archaic 1874
law criminalised cycling in city parks, and was occasionally used to
catch cyclists using trails to avoid automobile traffic. These
conditions, along with the global environmental movement, anti-war
protests, and the “bike boom” of the 70s, led to the formation of early
cycling advocacy organisations, including Le Monde à Bicyclette and Vélo
Québec.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-vive-la-vélorution" class="section level3">
<h3>“Vive la vélorution”</h3>
<p>Formed in 1975, Le Monde à Bicyclette (MAB) was an early cycling
advocacy group in Montreal, primarily led by Claire Morissette and
Robert “Bicycle Bob” Silverman. The group was known for their public
tactics, using comedy and theatrics to highlight relevant issues for
cyclists. One such tactic was the “die -in,” where dozens of
demonstrators would lay on a busy intersection, cover themselves in fake
blood, and use mangled bicycles, coffins, crutches, and stretchers to
convey the consequences of inadequate cycling infrastructure (Laforge,
2019). To demonstrate against the restriction of bicycles on the metro,
members of Le Monde à Bicyclette brought comically large objects on the
trains, including ladders, skis, and cardboard cut-outs of animals
(Walker, 2015). In another demonstration, Silverman dressed as Moses and
attempted to part the Saint Lawrence River, a form of protest against
the lack of bicycle lanes on the Jacques Cartier Bridge.</p>
<p>Le Monde à Bicyclette raised awareness of critical cycling issues to
the public and created a campaign that transformed how Montrealers
thought about cycling infrastructure. The organisation has been inactive
since 2000, but their actions paved the way for reforms that are
progressing today. In 2008, the “piste du boulevard de Maisonneuve”, a
two-lane bike path in downtown Montreal, was named the Claire-Morissette
Bike Path in honour of her cycling activism.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-vélo-québec" class="section level3">
<h3>Vélo Québec</h3>
<p>Vélo Québec is a major cycling advocacy group for the province of
Quebec and the city of Montreal, first formed in 1967 as a cycle tourism
agency known as the Fédération Cyclotouriste Provinciale (Vélo Québec,
2020). Similar to Le Monde à Bicyclette, Vélo Québec’s activism and
campaigning efforts arose from the cycling conditions of the 1970s. The
two organisations also collaborated, including joint displays of
solidarity on International Bicycle Day from 1977 to 1983, where over a
thousand cyclists biked from Parc la Fontaine to square Dorchester (Vélo
Québec, 2017).</p>
<p>From the 1970s to the present, Vélo Québec has continued to create
successful campaigns and events to promote cycling in Montreal. In 1992,
they launched Opération Dring Dring as part of the World Cycling
Conference, which promoted cycling as a mode of transit for work (Vélo
Québec, 2017). This initiative continued with the name Jour V from 2000
to 2002, before it was renamed Operation Bike-to-Work in 2003. More
recently in 2015, Vélo Québec created the Cycliste Averti program to
teach bicycle safety skills to elementary school students. In fact, the
organisation offers around fifty training sessions annually, including a
bike touring course, a group outings course, general cycling safety
courses, and an urban development course, to assist companies and
municipalities in creating safe cities for cyclists and pedestrians
(Vélo Québec, 2017).</p>
<p>Vélo Québec’s largest event is the Tour de l’Île de Montréal, an
annual cycling tour on a 36 km route through seven boroughs. First run
in 1985 after the creation of new bike paths in East Montreal, the Tour
de l’Île de Montréal celebrates cycling in Montreal. The first tour drew
3,500 participants, and grew rapidly in subsequent years (Vélo Québec,
2017). The tour has recorded over 45,000 participants in an individual
year and continues to be a popular event for cyclists today. The Tour de
l’Île de Montreal also serves as a political message to Montréal’s
leaders, signalling the vast number of Montrealers who depend on the
city’s cycling infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-from-activism-to-policy-the-1995-bicycle-policy"
class="section level3">
<h3>From activism to policy: the 1995 Bicycle Policy</h3>
<p>After years of activism demonstrating the importance of cycling,
Quebec acted to drastically increase cycling infrastructure. The 1995
Bicycle Policy, adapted by the Ministère des Transports (MTQ) and the
Société de l’assurance automobile du Québec (SAAQ), was the first major
policy for cycling in the province of Quebec. The policy emerged from
commitments at the 1992 Montréal Conférence Vélo Mondiale and public
input and addressed “the immediate needs of cyclists in terms of safety
and mobility” (Ministère des Transports du Québec, 2008, 7).
Furthermore, the bicycle policy addressed the underlying benefits of
cycling, reflecting a new effort to promote cycling as a means of active
transportation, in addition to being a leisure activity. The plan
introduced three broad objectives: gradual encouragement to use the
bicycle as a mode of transportation, the promotion of road safety with
cyclists and other road users, and the improvement of the transportation
system for cyclists (Ministère des Transports du Québec, 15).</p>
<p>While it did not transform Quebec into a cycling society at the scale
of some European nations, the 1995 bicycle policy provided the
foundation for decades of subsequent policy, legislation, and research.
Most importantly, research demonstrates that, following 1995, Quebecers
increasingly used cycling for transportation. From 1995 to 2005, the
proportion of cyclists using a bicycle for transportation (excluding
recreation, tourism, or training) increased 62%, from 21% to 34%
(Ministère des Transports du Québec, 2009, 9).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-bicycle-policy" class="section level3">
<h3>2008 bicycle policy</h3>
<p>The 2008 bicycle policy updated the 1995 policy with more specific
objectives for cycling and a new emphasis on cycling in urban areas.
First, the 2008 policy aimed to increase the modal share of cycling by
50% per agglomeration, with an increase in the Montreal agglomeration
from 1.2 % (2003) to 1.8% in 2020 (Ministère des Transports du Québec,
2008, 15). Second, the policy sought to reduce the number of cyclist
accident victims due to motor vehicles by 30% for 2020, compared to the
2002-2006 average. The third and final target was to increase the number
of kilometres of bikeways in Quebec by 30%, from 6,789 km in 2005 to
8,826 in 2020. These targets have successfully been met, or even
exceeded. As of 2022, Quebec has 12,000 km of bicycle paths, and by
2018, 3.3% of trips on the Island of Montreal were made by bicycle
(Bonjour Québec, n.d). Furthermore, there were 84 incidents of serious
injury or fatalities for cyclists in 2020, from an average of 189 in the
2002 to 2006 period (Vélo Québec, 2020, 15) - however, this comparison
does not account for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cycling
rates, and there are still many improvements to be made before there are
zero cycling injuries and fatalities.</p>
</div>
<div
id="section-the-current-city-framework-montreals-cycling-master-plan-2017"
class="section level3">
<h3>The current city framework: Montreal’s cycling Master Plan,
2017</h3>
<p>Montreal’s Cycling Master Plan from 2017 (Montréal, City of Cyclists,
2017) is a ten-part plan to increase cycling in Montreal, with the
overarching goal to increase the modal share of cycling to 15% in 15
years Unlike the provincial goals, it provides specific information
about which Montreal neighborhoods, or even streets, could use improved
cycling infrastructure. Below are the ten different goals as listed in
the master plan, and how the city plans on achieving them.</p>
<p>1.Deploy Montreal’s bike path network, with a focus on greater
connectivity, better access to centres of economic activity, and
improved integration with public transit: The city plans on creating
more protected bike paths to downtown, as bike paths on Rue Berri,
Boulevard Robert-Bourassa, and the Claire Morissette path along
Boulevard De Maisonneuve, are often busy at peak travel times. 2.Make
Montreal’s bike path network safe and accessible year-round: A
significant portion of this goal is improving winter maintenance for
bike paths. 3.Develop a bicycle accessibility plan for downtown: The
city plans on increasing downtown bicycle parking spaces, promoting
north-south bike paths in the downtown area, and increasing the
accessibility of bike lanes for tourists and visitors. 4.Implement bold,
large-scale cycling programs at the metropolitan level: The city will
utilize public and private partnerships for projects, and accelerate
large-scale cycling projects. 5.Improve the quality and supply of
bicycle parking across Montŕeal, particularly in central neighbourhoods:
Montreal will have private partners make plans for increasing bicycle
parking and will attempt to match bike parking to the rise in bicycle
use. 6.Integrate the needs of cyclists into the current road network as
well as road construction and reconstruction: The city will ensure that
bicycle routes are considered during road construction and will create
campaigns for drivers to raise awareness of cardooring, defined as when
a parked driver opens their door into a bike lane, which can strike
cyclists. 7.Install infrastructures or equipment that use innovations
and new technologies and thus reflect the functionalities proper to a
smart and digital city: The city hopes that collecting more data on
cyclists will create a better network, using new concepts or
technologies. An example of this is the “greenwave” for cyclists, which
is a name for synchronizing traffic lights to ensure that cyclists
encounter consecutive green lights at intersections. 8.Implement
projects and programs geared to organizations or cultural communities
with the goal of supporting and promoting initiatives that encourage
cycling: This goal is particularly interesting, as it hopes to use
cycling as a “catalyst and social development tool” for recent
immigrants to Montreal, while also promoting access to cycling through
new programs. 9.Develop partnerships with sporting associations,
schools, leisure groups, etc., with the goal of meeting the needs of all
clienteles: The city plans on creating partnerships with organisations
to promote cycling. One example of this is partnering with schools to
develop safe and child-friendly bike paths for children travelling to
and from school. 10.Promote cycling as a safe, effective and comfortable
mode of transport: This goal seeks to promote Montreal as a
cyclist-friendly city on an international scale, encourage BIXI bikes
with tourists, and promote cycling as transportation for Montrealers
(27).</p>
</div>
<div
id="section-the-current-provincial-framework-sustainable-mobility-policy-2018"
class="section level3">
<h3>The current provincial framework: Sustainable Mobility Policy,
2018</h3>
<p>Quebec’s Sustainable Mobility Policy from 2018 outlines the
province’s current objectives relating to active transport, including
cycling infrastructure, safety measures, and trip count targets. The
policy notes how separated bicycle paths with “priority at traffic
lights, traffic calming measures and the availability of safe bicycle
stands” will improve conditions for current cyclists, while also
attracting new riders (Sustainable Mobility Policy, 2030, 4). Winter
maintenance for bicycle paths is also acknowledged as an important part
of a safe and reliable network, demonstrating an effort to promote
cycling throughout the year.</p>
<p>Within the Sustainable Mobility Policy, the 2018-2023 Active
Transportation Action Plan outlines three targets to achieve by or
before 2030. First, the plan seeks to double the number of daily cycling
trips by 2028, compared to the number of daily recorded cycling trips
from 2013. This would mean increasing the number of daily trips made by
bicycle from 165,000 (2013) to 330,000 (Sustainable Mobility Policy
2030, 11). A second goal is to reduce pedestrian and cyclist “accident
victims” by 25%, compared to the average number of collisions between
2012 and 2016. The third and final goal is to consolidate and extend the
Route Verte (a network of over 5,300 cycling trails) by adding 858 km of
bicycle paths by 2030, which will increase connectivity and encourage
cycling across the province.</p>
<p>Overall, policies from 1995 onward have demonstrated a strong
commitment to cycling as a means of transportation. The rate of progress
has often outpaced projections, which is a promising trend that will
hopefully repeat itself with the 2018 mobility policy. While these
policies have certainly contributed to this success, other factors
outside of policies may also be responsible for driving the growth of
cycling infrastructure for Montreal.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-rise-of-bixi" class="section level3">
<h3>The rise of BIXI</h3>
<p>Public bike sharing services have existed since the 1960s, and recent
years have seen their dramatic growth in cities around the world.
Montreal’s BIXI bike service is the largest bike sharing program in
North America, recording over 50 million individual trips since its
inception in 2009 (BIXI Montréal, 2022). With BIXI, users have access to
roughly 700 stations located around Montreal, and have the option to
purchase yearly, monthly, seasonal, and daily passes, as well as the
option to pay for a single trip. After paying, one enters a code to
unlock a bike of their choosing and can drop it off at any BIXI stop.
Essentially, bike sharing services allow users to cycle for
transportation, without the liability and hassle of owning their own
bike.</p>
<p>Bike sharing services provide numerous benefits for cities. They lead
to higher rates of cycling, decrease traffic congestion, and reduce air
and noise pollution, while also increasing rates of physical activity
(Fuller et al., 2013). Research on Montreal demonstrates that
accessibility to BIXI bikes correlates with a greater likelihood of
cycling for individuals (Fuller et al., 2013). However, this increase of
cyclists also creates a higher demand for cycling infrastructure. As of
May 2022, BIXI is seeing record growth for users and trips, including
227,883 membership or access purchases, and 1,278,560 individual trips
in May alone ( BIXI Montréal, 2022). This growth is partially due to the
expansion of bike infrastructure projects, which have made using bike
sharing services easier to use over the past decade. However, this also
demonstrates the need for Montreal to further improve its network.
Luckily, the city has an ambitious project currently under
construction.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-improving-montreals-bikeability-the-rev"
class="section level3">
<h3>Improving Montreal’s bikeability: The REV</h3>
<p>Montreal’s cycling infrastructure has come a long way since the
automobile-era of the 1970s. According to the Copenhagenize Index
(2019), Montreal ranks first in Canada and 18th in the world for
bicycle-friendly cities. However, the city’s cycling infrastructure
still needs improvements, as disjointed bike networks present
navigational difficulties, and some major bike lanes are still not
separated for cyclist safety. The Réseau express vélo (REV) is a
large-scale cycling infrastructure project that seeks to address these
issues, and will form the backbone of Montreal’s cycling network. If all
17 of the proposed axes are completed, cyclists will have access to 184
km of mostly protected bike lanes, with year-round maintenance (Ville de
Montréal, 2022). Goals of the REV include improving accessibility and
safety for cyclists, while concurrently reducing greenhouse gas
emissions and improving quality of life. Ultimately, the city plans to
have over 15% of commuters travelling by bicycle in the next 10 years
(Wurst, 2020).</p>
<p>As part of Montreal’s broader transportation network, a completed REV
will double access to public transit access points, defined as points
within 50 meters of a metro station and within 25 meters of a bus stop
(Lacerte-Gauthier, 2022). The REV will also increase access to public
schools by bikes, including schools currently in disadvantaged areas
(Lacerte-Gauthier, 2022). While the city has already completed four
axes, including Berri / Lajeunesse / Saint-Denis Streets, Souligny
Avenue, Peel Street, and De Bellechasse Street, Vélo Québec has called
for an acceleration of the project timeline to respond to the continued
growth of cycling in Montreal (Couillard, 2019).</p>
</div>
<div id="section-from-the-past-to-the-future-of-cycling"
class="section level3">
<h3>From the past to the future of cycling</h3>
<p>It is important to reflect upon the present state of cycling in
Montreal, and the vast progress that has been achieved in the past fifty
years. Much is owed to early activists in the 1970s and 1980s for their
dedication to cycling advocacy, which laid the foundation for projects
and policies in the 1990s onwards. While looking back on the past, it is
also important to acknowledge that there is still much progress to be
made for the future. Today’s road conditions present new dangers that
were not present in the 1970s, such as an increase of larger vehicles on
the road, including SUVs, pickup trucks, and vans. Studies have shown
that larger vehicles are disproportionately deadly in a crash. From 2011
to 2019, 47 percent of cycling deaths in Quebec were from drivers in
heavy vehicles, despite the fact that they only account for 4 percent of
drivers, further demonstrating the need to provide protective
infrastructure for cyclists (Nerestant, 2021). To address this, cities
around the world have adopted “Vision Zero” policies, which recognize
that traffic collisions are preventable with better urban planning, and
that zero deaths or serious injuries on roads is achievable. Montreal’s
“Vision Zero” policy aims for zero deaths or serious injuries on roads
by 2040 and improving the city’s cycling infrastructure will undoubtedly
play a critical role in this policy’s success (Ville de Montréal,
2022).</p>
<p>As demonstrated by cycling leaders of the past, community activism
can play a vital role in advancing change. Montrealers of today can draw
on their successes to accelerate change in our own communities, while
holding leaders accountable to their ambitious targets. The “vélorution”
still lives on today, and the future of Montreal’s cycling
infrastructure is promising.</p>
<p>Note 1: it is unknown what the cause of removal was for each bike
lane labelled as “removed.” It is possible that they are represented as
removed due to construction, or another temporary measure, as opposed to
a full removal of the lane.</p>
<p>Note 2: The bike lanes in this map come from a different source,
without data on what was added and what was removed.</p>
