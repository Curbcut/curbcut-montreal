Plateau-Mont-Royal: tensions between beautification and privatisation of
public space</h1>
<h4 class="author">Emma Ezvan</h4>

</div>


<p>
The first green alley in Montreal was created in 1995 in Le
Plateau-Mont-Royal, at the intersection of Napoléon, Roy, du
Parc-Lafontaine and Mentana streets. The Green Alley Program
(<em>Programme des ruelles vertes</em>) enables residents to transform
public back alleys into green and community spaces, with financial and
technical support from the boroughs and the Éco-Quartiers Program. The
main objective is to revitalise spaces that are generally underused or
mainly used by cars, and to create urban spaces that are beneficial both
socially and environmentally.
</p>
<div id="section-a-borough-rich-in-green-alleys" class="section level3">
<h3>A borough rich in (green) alleys</h3>
<p>
At the time of writing, there are around 500 green alleys in Montreal,
in 12 of the 19 boroughs. Le Plateau-Mont-Royal, which is scheduled to
have 110 green alleys by the end of 2022, has the second highest number
of green alleys in the City; Rosemont-La-Petite-Patrie, with 136, has
the most. The Green Alley Program is particularly popular and successful
in Le Plateau. While some boroughs, such as Montreal North and
Ville-Marie struggle to have residents participate in the program, Le
Plateau is one of the boroughs that receives more applications than the
number of green alleys they can actually create. Since there are many
back alleys in Le Plateau, there is huge potential for the creation of
green alleys.

<p class="caption">
Figure 2. Back alleys and green alleys in Le Plateau-Mont-Royal.
</p>
</div>
<p>
The emergence of back alleys dates back to the 1840s; they are mostly
present in boroughs located in the central and southern parts of the
city that were built before World War II (Pham et al, 2022). Other
boroughs, such as Montreal North, Ahuntsic-Cartierville and
Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce have fewer, therefore presenting
less potential for the development of green alleys. Moreover, the
borough is very environmentally proactive. It has the highest budget for
the implementation of the Green Alley Program, spending around $50,000
per alley. They can therefore prioritise excavations that are more
expensive and that will have major environmental benefits.
</p>
<blockquote>
<q>In the Plateau we prioritize the environmental dimension. (…) There
are boroughs that have less of a budget that will focus more on social
things, but our vision in the borough is that the citizens can do it by
themselves. The borough does not have to be involved in the social
aspect of the alley… organizing a neighbours’ party… there is no cost to
that, or the costs are minimal. So we’re not going to finance the
neighbours’ parties every year. So the neighbours are able to organize
potlucks or things like that. But they can’t remove concrete. Our
priority is to do what they can’t do and what is expensive.</q> -Green
Alley Program manager in Le Plateau-Mont-Royal
</blockquote>
<p>
This priority given to the environmental aspect of the program seems to
be one of the specificities of Le Plateau. It is also the borough where
“<em>tronçons champêtres</em>” were invented (see Fig. 3). They are
sections of or entire green alleys that are closed to car circulation,
where the asphalt has been fully removed and greenery has been added.
These “<em>tronçons champêtres</em>” are expected to improve rainwater
management and reduce heat island effects.
</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

</p>
</div>
<p>
Finally, the environmental orientation of the borough is also seen in
the adoption of a bylaw in 2018 which bans the creation of new parking
spaces in alleys. Considering that cars and parking spaces are a major
obstacle to the greening and appropriation of back alleys, this new
measure is fundamental for the success of the Green Alley Program.
</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>The appropriation of green alleys and the creation of semi-private
spaces</h3>
<p>
Le Plateau also presents interesting characteristics in terms of
appropriation of the alleys. The Green Alley Program not only enables
public space appropriation by the residents of the alleys, but it also
encourages it. Appropriation can be achieved by greening the alley,
adding elements that create a sense of community, such as benches,
tables, play areas for children, or organising events for neighbours.
</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="stories/visuals/green_alleys_plateau/Fig.4.png" alt="Figure 4. Ruelle champêtre Henri-Julien/Drolet, Ma ruelle Marquette, ruelle Cachalot, Masson/de Bordeaux/Laurier/Chabot, rue Demers, Jeanne-Mance/Saint-Viateur/Esplanade/Fairmount" width="500" style="width:60%" />
<p class="caption">

Jeanne-Mance/Saint-Viateur/Esplanade/Fairmount
</p>
</div>
<p>
The appropriation of green alleys by residents can have different
motivations and outcomes. The <em>ruelle bariolée</em>, located close to
Square Saint-Louis, was created in 2006 in order to get rid of
undesirable uses. Indeed, people would come to consume drugs and leave
their garbage. As two residents explained: <em>“The idea was to make the
alley used to avoid undesirable uses, and it really is a success”</em>,
<em>“the idea really was to clean up the alley”</em>. Indeed, the
transformation of the alley and its improvement strikingly reduced these
undesired behaviours. The more a space is developed, improved and
maintained, the more it is respected, and the cleaner a space is the
cleaner it stays. The residents of the alley also decided to add
paintings on the floor to deter passers-by from leaving their cigarette
butts or other garbage in the alley. In the case of the <em>ruelle
bariolée</em>, the appropriation and beautification of the alley had
many positive outcomes. It became a more inviting space where people now
enjoy taking their walks and walking their dog. The redevelopment of the
alley also contributed to reducing car circulation: the alley is not
used as a shortcut anymore.
</p>
<p>
However, it seems that the appropriation of green alleys can also lead
to the semi-privatisation of public space. The fact that residents can
legally appropriate the alleys gives them power over this space and they
tend to create spaces where those who do not live in the alley sometimes
feel out of place, even if green alleys are part of the public realm.
The decoration of the alley and the organisation of events - most of the
time meant to be for residents of the alley only - tend to exclude those
who do not live in the alley.
</p>
<blockquote>
<q>The events… we try to really make them for the people of the alley,
but once we had made a call to all and some people came, we were like
‘ok who are you, you don’t even live close by’, it was a little
strange.</q> -Resident of the <em>ruelle bariolée</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
Such forms of appropriation of green alleys, with residents somehow
claiming ownership of these spaces, reinforce the ambiguity of green
alleys as shared public spaces supposed to benefit everyone. Green
alleys indeed tend to be seen by the residents living in the alley as an
extension of their courtyard, where they are in their “intimacy” as a
resident of a green alley in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie explained.
</p>
<blockquote>
<q>There are even people who do private things in the alley. Once we had
the whole Italian family over, it was Thanksgiving and the weather was
nice, we put everyone outside in the alley, everyone was happy. And
there are many people who do this, for children’s birthdays… In the idea
of making it live, it’s great…</q> -Resident of the <em>ruelle
bariolée</em>
</blockquote>
<p>
A more extreme example of privatisation is the case of Milton alley,
located at the intersection of Milton, Clark, Saint-Urbain and
Prince-Arthur Streets, where fences were installed at each end of the
alley. This decision was taken by the borough after receiving many
complaints from residents about people coming to their alley at night
during the weekend. The alley is very close to Saint-Laurent Boulevard,
and its multiple bars and clubs.
</p>
<blockquote>
<q>Well it is forbidden to fence off the public domain. But in this
case, we tolerate it because there was too much nuisance from people
who… there was theft, but there was also crime, people who were shooting
up, so they found syringes in the alley… a lot of condoms, all that. So
it was not safe. So it’s really for safety issues that we tolerate the
fact that it’s closed. It is supposed to be closed at night and then
reopened during the day. We don’t check everyday…</q> -Green Alley
Program manager in Le Plateau-Mont-Royal
</blockquote>
<p>
The fences are supposed to be closed on Thursday, Friday and Saturday
evenings. However, they seem to be closed more often than that. And a
new door with a code was installed at the beginning of the year on Clark
Street, making it even more complicated to enter the alley. Even if
there is a justification behind the installation of fences in order to
ensure the safety of the residents and the maintenance of the alley, it
still contributes to the privatisation of public space, and it seems
that the space is being privatised even more than what has been allowed
by the borough.

<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>
This fear of undesirable uses is expressed by many residents, as well as
by the persons in charge of the program. There is a particular emphasis
on the need to strategically choose the furniture that will be installed
in the alley:
</p>
<blockquote>
<q>But sometimes we don’t install benches as part of our green alley
projects because we don’t want to have to manage nuisances. So what we
often say… because people almost systematically include benches in their
projects. Then we give them advice, we tell them ‘it’s as you wish… we
could integrate benches’. If they’re next to Mount-Royal, it’s sure I’m
gonna say no. But if they are a bit far away, if there are no adjacent
bars, if they don’t already have a problem with night-time nuisances, we
could provide them with benches, we have already done so in the past.
But I would strongly suggest that they take benches or folding chairs
out of their yard when they want to enjoy the alley, and then they can
bring them back in at night. That way, there is no problem at night.
Usually, citizens are like ‘yeah, you’re right’. I don’t really have to
convince them.</q> -Green Alley Program manager in Le Plateau-Mont-Royal
</blockquote>
<p>
A resident of ruelle Nelligan, also located next to Square Saint-Louis
and created in 2020, indeed had this discussion with the program manager
when they started the project. The residents wanted to put benches,
<em>“but the City said ’be careful with that, it invites people you
don’t want in the alley, so if you want to do something, bring your own
chairs, have a party, and then take the chairs away”</em>. This desire
to avoid undesirable uses somehow underlines the idea that green alleys
are bound to become semi-private spaces that can be protected from the
nuisances of regular public space.
<p>
Green alleys definitely are interesting urban spaces, at the
intersection of the public and the private realms. The revitalisation of
these spaces that used to be underused contributes to transforming them
into usable and attractive spaces that are greener, quieter and cooler
alternatives to other streets. Green alleys are ambiguous spaces that
offer potential for privatisation and the program encourages that.
Indeed, the appropriation of alleys by residents also ensures their
involvement in the maintenance of the alley in the long term. But the
privatisation of the alleys sometimes results in the exclusion of some
persons or groups of people that feel less comfortable using the alleys.
