to a water wheel in the growth machine</h1>
<h4 class="author">Camille Forest</h4>

</div>


<p>
The jurisdictional landscape of water management services in Canada is
self-conflicting, where all levels of government have responsibilities
that depend on actions by other levels of government. In Canada, the
federal government is responsible for keeping major waterways clear and
maintaining of fisheries through ensuring clean fish habitats
(Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2016). Municipalities are
responsible for storm water overflow, and the provinces are responsible
for most other water quality and management services; all of which can
impact fisheries. However, the province of Quebec has both historically
and currently delegated maintaining water quality, including storm and
wastewater, to municipalities. The distribution of responsibilities
across levels of government has historically resulted in jurisdictional
gridlock from the federal government and provinces (Boone, 1996). This
case study illustrates how in the absence of action by federal and
provincial governments, the most local levels of government and
community governance define their relationship with water in the city.
</p>
<p>
Griffintown is a neighbourhood in Montreal with complex and turbulent
history of neglect by local governance, and this essay will tease out
how Griffintown’s social and governance history can be defined through
the politics of water management. In his <em>History of Montreal</em>,
Steven Leacock describes Griffintown as:
</p>
<p>
<em>“…the area west of McGill Street, between the new railway and the
new canal. This wretched area, whose tumbled, shabby houses mock at the
wealth of Montreal, was the first of our industrial slums, the gift of
the machine age…” and “the unhappy settlement of Griffintown…built on
low land for working class, who must take what they can get…”</em>
</p>
<p>
As Leacock noted, the origin of the neighbourhood was as an industrial
slum home to mainly recent immigrant Irish factory workers and a
neighbourhood subjected to devastating seasonal floods. The mostly
low-income, racialized residents, with poor sanitation service provision
and regular flooding combined to create the conditions for Griffintown
to be the most disease-ridden neighbourhood in Montreal (Home-Douglas,
2007). However, this ‘slum’ was important to the early growth of
Montreal through its function as the industrial heart of the city,
providing conditions for its economic growth during the Industrial
Revolution.
</p>
<p>
The governance of present-day Griffintown bears little resemblance to
this neglect and stigma, where developer speculation dominates its
landscape. However, the lack of a timely comprehensive planning process
by the city has hindered the ability to properly plan for water in the
neighbourhood. Further, the city’s generous granting of high-rise
re-zonings indicate the neighbourhood may be continuing to experience
inadequate, profit-driven governance. The articulation of the city as a
growth machine, meant to churn out ever-increasing net income, is a
poignant analogy for the recent development of Griffintown (Logan &amp;
Molotch, 2007). This politics of growth applies to water management
policy as much as any realm of urban governance. The history of local
governance and water in Griffintown illustrates Logan and Moloch’s
(2007) argument that planning which encourages growth without first
questioning whether there is a social desire for growth will result in a
“bias in favour of the speculators and against the working class” and
against community good in this case.  Herein, the evolution of local
politics and urban governance in Griffintown, from an urban slum to a
developer’s dream, has been defined by neglecting working class
residents and this neglect is mirrored in the history of the
neighbourhood’s water management.
</p>
<div id="section-from-the-nazareth-fief-to-the-birth-of-griffintown"
class="section level3">
<h3>From the Nazareth Fief to the Birth of Griffintown</h3>
<p>
Griffintown was an undesirable place for settlement in Montreal’s early
development due to its position on low-lying, marshy land. South of
Montreal’s original Port, now known as the Old Port, it was originally a
marshy fiefdom called Nazareth Fief, and unofficially referred to as<em>
Le Grange des Pauvres </em>(Griffinworks, n/a). The fortification of
early Montreal, then known as Ville Marie, resulted in large stone walls
cutting Nazareth Fief off from the budding city. When a fire destroyed
half of Ville Marie in 1721 and an ordinance was issued that all
buildings inside Ville Marie must be constructed by masonry. Poor
residents who could only afford to build their homes with wood began to
build Montreal’s first suburb in the Nazareth fief (Mofarrahi, 2009).
When Ville Marie’s fortification walls came down by 1817, the Nazareth
Fief became integrated into Montreal’s governance and receiving services
such as roads and beginning to contribute to the city’s economy (Marsan,
1981).
</p>
<p>
Irish immigrants, pushed to emigrate by the Potato Famine and land
reforms, continued to settle in Griffintown looking for work, the
neighbourhood became a key economic driver of early Montreal. This was
propelled by large construction projects in the area, such as the
Lachine Canal, Grand Trunk Railroad depot and the Victoria bridge, as
well as the heavy industry located in the neighbourhood which employed
4000 men, women, and children from the neighbourhood (Mofarrahi, 2009;
Solonysznyj, 1988). Griffintown’s industrial operations led Montreal’s
Industrial Revolution due to the sheer number of industrial complexes
housed in the neighbourhood and because of its proximity to the
construction of the Lachine Canal (Mofarrahi, 2009). The Lachine Canal
is cited as the most significant event of Montreal’s Industrial
Revolution, through allowing shipping to bypass the Lachine rapids and
carry manufactured goods West, into upper Canada. (Home-Douglas, 2017;
Mofarrahi, 2009).
</p>
<p>
Once the construction of the Lachine Canal finished in 1825,
Griffintown’s importance as an economic engine for Montreal was
cemented; by 1860 more than 50 factories were operating in Griffintown
(Mofarrahi, 2009). Despite the city providing basic utilities to the
neighbourhood between 1880-1915, Montreal as a city was known for some
of the worst public health conditions in any industrialized nation
during this period, with poor garbage removal and poor access to clean
drinking water (Ames,1972). Griffintown was the neighbourhood in
Montreal hardest hit by disease and infant mortality. Sanitation
challenges were exacerbated for the residents of Griffintown compared to
the rest of the city, because many families lived in overcrowded homes,
only half had toilets, and they all faced persistent seasonal flooding.
</p>
<p>
Spring floods during this period were primarily caused by ice jams and
snow melt raising water levels in the St. Lawrence (Hanna, 2007).
Inundation of homes and factories worsened public health conditions and
likely contributed to the poorest public health outcomes of the city
being clustered in the Griffintown area (Mofarrahi, 2009; Hanna, 2007).
Flooding also had a social impact on the community: surviving the
perennial flooding bonded the residents and created a resilient spirit
among them where people made “the best of a bad situation by boating
around serenading one another in song accompanied by guitars, fiddles
and ‘music boxes.’ This helped them to forget the big task that lay
ahead, the yearly ‘clean up’ after the waters receded” (Gubbay, 1981).
Without any formal assistance from the local government, the community
was solely responsible for dealing with its problems with water.

</p>
</div>
<p>
The worst flood on record in Montreal occurred in 1886, and although
Griffintown was accustomed to the multiple feet of water inundating
their neighbourhood, this flood was considered disastrous and costly
because it also affected the Port and caused the temporary closing of
factories in Griffintown (Ref. Figure 1). The flood of 1886 is a key
reference for the historical high point of water in the city of
Montreal, and notable for the flooding of wealthy neighbourhoods at
higher elevations, which caught the attention and passion the municipal
level of government. During the 1880’s &amp; 1890’s, the federal and
provincial government had yet to formally assign responsibility for
water management to any level government, and thus local communities and
the City of Montreal were on their own to solve any urban water
challenges.
</p>
<p>
Known as ‘a mayor for the port,’ Mayor Raymond Préfontaine responded to
cost of these seasonal floods through commissioning the construction of
a floodwall in 1899 (Ville de Montreal, nd). The wall, which is now part
of the Cité-du-Havre, stands 1,561 meters long and 56 cm higher than the
highest point to the 1886’ flood (Montpetit, 2017). This floodwall
provided protection of the economic heart of the city: the Port and the
Lachine Canal. However, while the floodwall was pitched in 1899 as the
solution to Montreal’s flooding problem – the slogan for the wall was
‘there will be no more flooding’ – this has not proved to be entirely
true (Ville de Montreal, N/A).
</p>
</div>
<div id="section-griffintown-as-a-ghost-town" class="section level3">
<h3>Griffintown as a Ghost Town</h3>
<p>
Governance concerns about flooding in Griffintown dissipated with the
departure of most residents. Instead, the municipal government focused
on making sure the land served a purpose to Montreal’s urban growth
through the 1970s and 1980s, through developing the now-sparsely
populated area into a concrete matrix of industrial complexes,
complimented by a highway.
</p>
<p>
With the opening of the St Lawrence seaway in 1959, the Lachine Canal,
once a key tool for the economic development strategy of Montreal,
became obsolete (Home-Douglas,2017). After the closing of the canal,
Griffintown’s fortunes as a neighbourhood worsened – the strategic value
of its land and industry was diminished without the Lachine Canal as a
crucial shipping route. Despite the reduction in flooding, living
conditions remained relatively poor in the neighbourhood during the
first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.
</p>
<p>
As industry began leaving the neighbourhood in the 1930’s and 1940’s, a
series of local governance actions accelerated the decline of the
neighbourhood (Mofarrahi, 2009). An area of shacks, abandoned factories
and community centres stood as relics from the once booming industrial
neighbourhood. The land was slowly cleared of residents, and then
cultural heritage.
</p>
<p>
In 1963, Montréal Mayor Jean Drapeau zoned the entire neighbourhood as
industrial, prohibiting community development or rebuilding in the area
(Home-Douglas, 2017). At this time, Griffintown’s remaining residents
also experienced the building of the Bonaventure Expressway through
their community, decimating factories and homes and uprooting almost all
remaining residents (Home-Douglas, 2017). In the late 60’s,
Griffintown’s population dropped to fewer than six hundred people, as
the governance strategy for the neighbourhood seemed to be intentionally
clearing the area of any residential or cultural presence (Home-Douglas,
2017).

<h3>The Revival of Both Griffintown and Neglected Flood Risks</h3>
<p>
While Mayor Préfontaine addressed seasonal floods for Old Port and
Griffintown in 1899, the West Island and most municipalities in the
<em>Communauté Métropolitaine de Montréal</em> (CMM) continue to
struggle with the spring-time floods to this day. However, due to the
increasing frequency and intensity of large rainfall events, as well as
less predictable weather patterns, flooding has re-emerged in recent
years as an important planning consideration for Montreal’s downtown
neighbourhoods. One poignant example of this is the Montreal flood of
1987 where 100 mm of rain fell within an hour, flooding expressways with
nearly 4m of water, backing up the sewer system into approximately
40,000 homes and businesses, closing the subway system and killing two
people (Public Safety Canada, 2013).

<p>
By 1990, Montreal had grown both in population and sprawl enough that
post-industrial Griffintown became valuable land to the city for
development. The downtown had expanded enough that Griffintown was then
the last undeveloped neighbourhood adjacent to downtown. The city’s
ambitions for Griffintown in the 1990s lacked a comprehensive planning
process and consisted of the city selling land to developers and
approving numerous rezoning applications for high rise developments. The
City of Montreal was looking for the neighbourhood to provide an
economic boost to the city just as it had back in the early
19<sup>th</sup> Century. This time, however, through gentrification.
</p>
<p>
Following the re-zoning of a number of significant parcels and budding
gentrification in the area, the square-foot price of land in Griffintown
increased from 8$-20$/sqft in 2005 to 300$/sqft in 2015 (Friede, 2015).
Most recently, community backlash from the lack of community services
and amenities provision, such as greenspace, transportation, schools,
etc., has prompted a shift in the branding and apparent focus of
Griffintown’s redevelopment.
</p>
<p>
The newest planning programs highlight sustainable community development
as well as economic growth in the region (FIX-INNO, 2020; Lemieux,
2018). The neglect of Griffintown’s community interests in its recent
planning is now attempting to be rectified by integrating proper water
management techniques for the community, such as the areas first
permeable pavement pedestrian street in Montreal, which allows for
on-site absorption and filtration of overflow water (FIX-INNO, 2020) and
a large retention basin connected to the city’s storm and wastewater
pipes, in Marie Griffin Park (Lemieux, 2018). This retention basin will
be an overflow catchment of water for the city’s wastewater system,
which hopefully reduces the risk of a sewer system back up, as occurred
in the flood of 1987’.
</p>
<p>
However, the initial lack of comprehensive planning has hindered the
city’s ability to plan for water in the neighbourhood in some key ways.
It is now much more expensive for the city to acquire land for public
greenspace and therefore their ability to plan a connective network of
green urban infrastructure to optimise the hydrology of the area has
been significantly hindered.

</div>
<p>
 The recent emergence of water management as a top priority for Montreal
and Quebec planners is likely because of the increasing cost of flooding
to urban infrastructure. This is a direct threat to a neoliberal,
profit-driven logic that requires growth of the physical and economic
city. In 2019, devastating flooding hit the West Island and Laval,
prompting the Province of Quebec to ban reconstruction of homes damaged
by the flood and new developments within the most recent flood line
(Anhoury, 2019).
</p>
<p>
When the province released its map of flood risk zones (Ref. Figure 3 –
left), there were outcries from developers whose land was within flood
zone boundaries. The province’s new regulations were jeopardizing
developer investments and profits. The developer complaints, based on
how water levels were estimated, led to the reconfiguration of flood
zones to cover less area (as shown in Figure 3 – right). Comprehensive
records and maps of flood risk are managed by provincial and federal
agencies, and primarily address flooding from large waterways. For
example, the flash flood of 2012 (Ref. Figure 2) is not mentioned in the
Canadian public health database for significant floods (Public Safety
Canada, 2013). This database illustrates a key influence the federal
government has over flood-related planning decisions that did not exist
during Griffintown’s early history. Specifically, which floods are
tracked and used to inform planning decisions may tell one story and
funnel funding into a certain type of flood mitigation without a
comprehensive picture of all the floods that are occurring in Montreal.
</p>
<p>
Another new role of the federal government in flood mitigation and
planning for Montreal has been in the form of funding. In 2019, Prime
Minister Trudeau announced 50$ million for wetland protection and
upgrading pump stations and valves on the West Island (Prime Minister’s
Office, 2019). Both the federal funding of flood infrastructure and the
provincial flood mapping that make up more modern urban governance of
flood mitigation rely heavily on local governance dynamics of developer
interests and municipal planning of projects.
</p>
<p>
Also in 2019, the CMM released a comprehensive risk assessment guide for
the 82 municipalities making up the agglomeration (CMM, 2019). At the
level of the municipal agglomeration, planning processes that concern
flooding result in guiding principles for individual municipal and
community decision makers. Thus, the modern state of urban governance of
water in Griffintown is still dominated by the community’s relationship
with the city. Both federal and provincial flood data is myopically
focused on flooding from the St. Lawrence, as illustrated by the lack of
comprehensive data in the Canadian Disaster Database and that Quebec’s
flood zone mapping is based solely on the 2019 spring flood from the
St. Lawrence (and subsequently walked back to appease developer
interests). Therefore, the primary form of flooding that effects
Griffintown now, flooding from storm water overflow, is poorly studied,
and mapped, meaning funding and planning for this risk will likely be
lacking in the future.
</p>
</div>
<div id="section-conclusion" class="section level3">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
The future of planning for water flooding in Griffintown is at a
crossroads. There is significant public pressure to prioritize community
needs for the first time in Griffintown’s history, which has led to some
flooding mitigation infrastructure. However, the lack of data for
flooding, specifically from storm water, in government databases and
maps biases municipalities to neglect the flooding risks that threaten
Griffintown. Given developer interest in developing the area this is
unlikely to change without specific community demands.
</p>
<p>
This case study overviews a long history of governance driven by a logic
of growth, which has left community well-being out of Griffintown’s
planning process. Research showing that storm-water flooding is also a
large future potential cost of flooding and community advocacy for
climate resilient development will be a key to effective planning
processes concerned with water management in Griffintown in the future.
