<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Environmental racism and green
gentrification in Montreal’s Little Burgundy</h1>
<h3 class="subtitle">A neighbourhood in transformation</h3>
<h4 class="author">Sara Hashemi</h4>

</div>


<p>
Over the last several years, organizers in Little Burgundy have been
trying to
<a href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2021/02/18/in-montreals-little-burgundy-hopes-of-reviving-a-hub-of-the-citys-black-community.html">revive
the Negro Community Centre</a> (NCC), which once stood at the corner of
Coursol and Canning Streets.
</p>
<p>
Established in 1927, the NCC provided a range of health and social
services for the community until it closed in 1992. After sitting empty
for years, the building that was once its home was demolished in 2014.
</p>
<p>
Organizations such as the NCC have struggled to stay afloat amidst the
multiple waves of gentrification which have swept over Little Burgundy
in the last century. The neighbourhood, located in the Southwest of
Montreal, has been in a constant state of transformation. The area has
had different names over the course of its existence: Ste-Cunégonde,
Saint-Antoine, and Faubourg St. Joseph. The current name “Little
Burgundy” was chosen in the 1960s, when city officials used the name to
describe the major urban renewal program they planned to adopt for the
area.
</p>
<p>
Much like Little Burgundy itself, the NCC has had many lives—first at
the <a href="https://www.unionunitedchurchmtl.ca/history.htm">Union
United Church</a>, then at 2035 Coursol Street, and now, as part of a
revival project hoping to regain what was once the heart of Black
community in Montreal.
</p>
<div

class="section level3">
<h3>Little Burgundy as the home of Montreal’s Black community</h3>
<p>
The emergence of Montreal as a railway hub in the late nineteenth
century led to significant Black migration to the city. Anti-Black
racism
<a href="https://niche-canada.org/2020/10/20/green-gentrification-race-and-class-exclusion-in-an-urban-national-park/">excluded</a>
Black Montrealers from working in factories. Instead, Black men worked
for railway companies as sleeping car porters, dining car employees, and
<a href="https://www.uncoveringuniontrm.com/the-red-caps-porters">Red
Caps</a>.
</p>
<p>
While Canada didn’t have legalized segregation in this time period like
in the United States, white landlords often
<a href="https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/uhr/2017-v46-n1-uhr04514/1059112ar/">refused
to rent</a> to Black people. The English-speaking Black community
<a href="https://www.vehiculepress.com/q.php?EAN=9781550650655">settled</a>
in Little Burgundy, known as the St-Antoine district at the time,
because of its proximity to the Windsor and Bonaventure train stations,
and because of the barriers to housing they faced in other parts of the
city. As a result, a Black community began to develop in the area.
</p>
<p>
Black culture
<a href="https://www.vehiculepress.com/q.php?EAN=9781550650655">flourished</a>
in the neighbourhood during the 1920s. St-Antoine became a hub for jazz
music, especially as Prohibition in the United States drew people to
Montreal. Legendary pianists such as Oscar Peterson and Oliver Jones,
both the sons of rail workers, began their careers in St-Antoine. Jazz
clubs such as Rockhead’s Paradise, the first to be owned by a Black
businessman, attracted famous performers such as Duke Ellington, Louis
Armstrong, Billie Holiday, and Ella Fitzgerald.
</p>
<p>
The NCC was established in 1927, with the aim of improving the social
and economic conditions of the Black community in Montreal, though it
also provided services to anyone who needed them. In her book <em>The
Road to Now</em>, historian Dorothy Williams writes that “the NCC
functioned as a representative for black Montreal, as a protector of
human rights, and as a facilitator for black participation in all areas
of society.”

<div id="section-urban-slum-urban-renewal" class="section level3">
<h3>Urban “slum,” urban “renewal”</h3>
<p>
The 1960s and 70s were a period of transformation for Little Burgundy,
and the Sud-Ouest in general, as the decline of passenger train travel
and factory work undermined the area’s economic foundations. Residents
began leaving working-class neighbourhoods due to a lack of employment
opportunities, or because they could now afford to move to other areas.
Many incoming Black immigrants chose to settle in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce
and Lasalle rather than Little Burgundy. However, the City also played a
major role in Little Burgundy’s depopulation, under the guise of “urban
renewal.”
</p>
<p>
Urban renewal projects such as the one in Little Burgundy were common at
this time, and they drastically changed the landscape of North American
cities,
<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/urban-renewal-projects-maps-united-states#:~:text=Urban%20renewal%20projects%20changed%20the,replace%20them%20with%20affordable%20housing.&amp;text=So%20far%20the%20team%20has%20mapped%20about%20600%20urban%20renewal%20projects.">especially
in the United States</a>. Urban renewal policies were implemented in
neighbourhoods considered by officials to be in a state of decay and
were typically aimed at “slum clearance.” Housing considered to be
sub-standard would be razed and redeveloped, often into housing, office
space, or shopping centres. While the so-called “renewal” of
neighbourhoods could be seen as positive for residents, the changes
enacted by urban renewal projects
<a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/28/2/243/4633688">often
led</a> to low-income and racialized residents being displaced in favour
of wealthier—and whiter—residents. Even the language used to justify
urban renewal facilitated this dispossession—describing neighbourhoods
as “slums”
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-10/the-case-for-retiring-the-word-slum">stereotyped</a>
low-income neighbourhoods as centres of criminality, and legitimized the
idea of clearing them out.
</p>
<p>
In post-war Montreal, Mayor Jean Drapeau embarked on a rapid
modernization project for the city; highways were built, the city centre
was expanded, and a metro system was created. The arrival of Expo 67
also meant that the city centre needed to be attractive to tourists.
Entire neighbourhoods were cast by city officials as “urban slums” and
demolished. As in the case of other North American cities undergoing
similar transformations, it was marginalized communities who bore the
brunt of these initiatives, including the residents of St-Antoine.
</p>
<p>
While the language of the renewal program focused on social uplifting,
<a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/211520103.pdf">scholar Robert
Mayer argued</a>, on the basis of an analysis of city plans, that the
Little Burgundy urban renewal program was designed to improve the
profitability of the neighbourhood rather than the living conditions of
its residents. The city used Little Burgundy’s declining population and
poor housing conditions to justify its urban renewal project, but it did
little to ensure residents could stay in their community.
</p>
<p>
Montreal acquired over 75% of the land in the St-Antoine district for
urban renewal and construction of a highway. The land in the
northeastern part of the neighbourhood was turned into 314 low-cost
housing units. These developments forcibly displaced hundreds of
families whose homes were demolished. Many more also left voluntarily,
not wanting to live in fear of their home being expropriated.
</p>
<p>
At the same time, the construction of the Ville-Marie
Expressway—<a href="https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/uhr/1900-v1-n1-uhr04514/1059112ar/">which
largely benefited middle and upper-class suburban workers driving
downtown</a>—led to the demolition of huge parts of Little Burgundy. The
city targeted the northern part of the neighbourhood for
construction—the area where most of the Black community was
concentrated. This was a common trend in the building of freeways after
the Second World War: they
<a href="https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1208&amp;context=curej">were
routed, often purposefully, through Black and brown communities</a>.
Living near highways comes with
<a href="https://www.lung.org/clean-air/outdoors/who-is-at-risk/highways">increased
health risks</a>, and highways
<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/07/984784455/a-brief-history-of-how-racism-shaped-interstate-highways">cut
off</a> entire communities from the rest of the city. Given modern
planning’s history of racism and displacement of Black residents, it’s
no coincidence that a Black community was targeted as the area for these
developments in Montreal.
</p>
<p>
Throughout these processes,
<a href="https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/uhr/1900-v1-n1-uhr04514/1059112ar/">NCC’s
leadership was</a> “keeping a vigilant eye on possible impending
physical and structural changes in the neighbourhood, for example, the
approaches to the Champlain Bridge, the proximity of our area to the
World Fair [Expo 67] site and the gradual westward trend in the building
of highrise apartment and office complexes.”
</p>
<p>
But by the end of the 70s, Little Burgundy was an entirely different
neighbourhood. Its population had plummeted
<a href="https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-remembering-the-little-burgundy-expropriations">from
14,710 in 1966 to just 7,000 in 1973</a>. Having moved to other
neighbourhoods, only a fraction of the Black community still resided in
Little Burgundy. The city razed Black-owned businesses and
organizations, and many others were forced to shut down because of
declining clientele. The web of community that brought Black residents
to Little Burgundy had almost entirely disappeared. Over the course of
the 1980s, wealthier families began moving into the neighbourhood. A
1988 study looking at families with school-age children in 404 districts
conducted by the Montreal Island School Council indicated that
Montreal’s poorest families had been “expelled” from Little Burgundy by
wealthier residents. In 1981, Little Burgundy was ranked as the sixth
poorest of all districts. By 1986, it had dropped to 295th.
</p>
<p>
The NCC’s membership
<a href="https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/uhr/1900-v1-n1-uhr04514/1059112ar/">fell</a>
from 973 in 1959 to just around 300 by the mid-1970s. Black residents
continued to move out of Little Burgundy, and small Black communities
formed elsewhere in Montreal. The NCC closed in 1989, though volunteers
continued to staff the building until 1992.
</p>
<p>
The post-renewal period was also marked by an increase in police
violence towards Black residents. In January 1985, the Black Community
Coalition of Quebec (BCCQ) wrote to Mayor Drapeau about the “increasing
incidents of police violence between the MUC police and especially the
black residents of Little Burgundy.” A 1991 article in the <em>Montreal
Gazette</em> described “tremendous fear (of police) in Little Burgundy”
after a major drug cleanup operation.
</p>
<p>
Steven High, a historian who has written extensively about the
Sud-Ouest,
<a href="https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/uhr/1900-v1-n1-uhr04514/1059112ar/#no83">writes
that</a> “It is not coincidental that public recognition of the
neighbourhood’s [B]lack presence came during the 1980s, when Little
Burgundy was in profound crisis and publicly associated with crack,
crime, and youth gangs. Public housing had, by then, also become firmly
associated with racial minorities and poverty in the United States and
parts of Canada.”

class="section level3">
<h3>The revitalization of the Lachine canal and ongoing
gentrification</h3>
<p>
Today, Little Burgundy is still undergoing major changes. The Lachine
Canal’s surroundings have become the site of “green gentrification,” a
process in which greening initiatives draw in wealthier residents and
push out low-income residents. As Gould and Lewis (2016) write in their
book <em>Green Gentrification: Urban Sustainability and the Struggle for
Environmental Justice</em>:
</p>
<p>
“In green gentrification, existing and potential environmental amenities
price out the current group of residents and draw in a wealthier group.
[…] In many instances, such green-led redevelopment is intentional, as
investors and public officials create new or renewed green spaces as a
means to raise property values and tax revenues.”
</p>
<p>
Parks Canada has played a major role in the changing landscape of Little
Burgundy. After the Lachine Canal closed to commercial shipping in 1970,
Parks Canada took over the site. It converted the canal’s surroundings
into a linear park that extends from Old Montreal to Lac St-Louis, and
reopened the waterway to pleasure boating in 2002, making the area more
attractive to affluent households.
</p>
<p>
The revitalization of the Lachine Canal park
<a href="https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/lsp/2010-n63-lsp3885/044156ar/">has
favoured the rehabilitation of brownfields for luxury residential
purposes</a>. The area along the Canal, which once housed factories,
<a href="https://montrealgazette.com/opinion/opinion-from-balconville-to-condoville-in-montreals-southwest">has
been rezoned as residential</a>. This new residential development has
altered the neighbourhood’s demographics. Between 1996 and 2016, the
number of dwellings in Little Burgundy increased rapidly, and so did the
number of people who own their home instead of renting. Building owners
have also been hiking rents as the neighbourhood continues to gentrify,
so residents are also predictably wealthier than they were in the 90s.
</p>
<p>
The shift in the neighbourhood’s landscape is equally apparent in
newspaper articles written about the neighbourhood over the last two
decades, which have shifted from describing violence and drug sweeps to
reporting on condo developments, new businesses, and trendy restaurants.
In a 2015 Gazette article describing Little Burgundy’s “evolution” from
its working-class roots, real-estate broker Tanya Boni describes a new
condo development as “[perfect] for people who want to live in the city,
but don’t want to compromise on green space.”
</p>
<p>
While many areas of Little Burgundy have been turned into luxury
housing, there is still a concentration of low-income residents. Notre
Dame Street is filled with upscale restaurants and cafés, yet other
<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/little-burgundy-s-food-desert-problem-1.5701095">parts
of the neighbourhood qualify as a food desert</a>. Residents also face
eviction as developers move to turn buildings into condos and short-term
rental units. In January 2019, tenants in a six-unit building on
Notre-Dame St. W
<a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/little-burgundy-tenants-fight-eviction-in-place-of-short-term-rentals-1.4254943">learned
that they were being evicted</a> and that their apartments would be
turned into short-term rental units for sites like Airbnb, an
increasingly common phenomenon in Montreal.
</p>
<p>
The NCC filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after one of its walls collapsed,
and the land was bought by a private condo developer—a sadly fitting end
for a site in Little Burgundy. The building was
<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/montreal-s-negro-community-centre-demolished-1.2844166">demolished</a>
in 2014. One of the last architectural traces of the Black community’s
history in the neighbourhood was now gone.
</p>
<p>
Organizers at Revive NCC are now hoping to reappropriate the NCC site
and <a href="https://revivencc.org/">offer</a> various services and
programming alongside a museum space showcasing the contributions of the
Anglophone Black community to the development of Montreal.
</p>
<p>
The organizers currently working to revive the NCC must reckon with
Little Burgundy’s evolving landscape, especially as there have been
multiple movements to re-open the centre over the years. Jared Roboz,
the vice-president of the board of Revive NCC says, “Some people just
don’t have the confidence in the movement anymore. And I can understand
why, because they’ve seen Little Burgundy transform in a way that they
really did not expect or understand. They walk through their
neighbourhood, and they don’t see the same kind of people, they don’t
see the same kind of community. The NCC is just one example of how the
community has been mistreated.” Race and class have played an important
role in how the city has implemented various policies and programs in
Little Burgundy. As the neighbourhood continues to face gentrification,
racism and inequality will continue to shape Little Burgundy’s
landscape.
