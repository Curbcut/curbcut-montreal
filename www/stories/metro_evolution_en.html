<h4 class="author">Lauren Rosenthal</h4>

</div>


<p>Public transit in Montreal has undergone a tremendous transformation
since the early 20th century, with the metro system forming a central,
emblematic part of it. The evolution of the metro has been far from
linear, and the decisions that were made often spoke volumes about the
city’s priorities and self-perception. This is the history of the
Montreal metro, how it arrived at its present state, and what its future
holds.</p>

<h3>Early transit in Montreal and the first metro proposal</h3>
<div id="section-section" class="section level4">
<h4><em>1910</em></h4>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, public transportation in
Montreal was dominated by an extensive network of streetcars that served
the growing population in the city center. As the population grew,
however, street congestion did as well, leading to major streetcar
punctuality issues. The initial consideration of underground
transportation arose from the desire for a public transit system that
could operate in spite of the heavy traffic on the streets (Clairoux,
2001).</p>
<p>The Montreal Street Railway Company, which was in charge of the
tramway system, began to study the possibility of a metro system in
Montreal in 1910. At this time, other major European and North American
cities were in the process of establishing their own metro systems
(Société de transport de Montréal, n.d.), making it logical for Montreal
to follow suit given its rapidly growing economy and population. An
underground system could be both a solution to the issue of overcrowded
streets and an opportunity for Montréal to modernize in pace with other
major cities.</p>
<p>The initial proposal for underground transit was made in 1910,
consisting of a single line running mainly along Parc/de Bleury (Dufour,
n.d.-a). These tunnels were more so meant for circulating streetcars
underground, however, as opposed to serving as a bonafide metro plan
(Société de transport de Montréal, n.d.).</p>

<p>Despite this proposal and several others being put forward in the
following years, nothing materialized in the early 20th century. The
first world war, followed by the Great Depression, prevented the
approval and granting of funding to any metro projects, as the city was
plunged into economic crisis, and street crowding was vastly reduced,
alleviating the traffic issues necessitating underground transit
(Gilbert, 2021).</p>

<div id="section-section-1" class="section level4">
<h4><em>1944-1953</em></h4>
<p>The alleviated traffic did not last. Ramifications from the Second
World War in Montreal increased crowding in trams once again, in part
due to the rationing of gasoline (Scott, 2016), reigniting the calls for
underground transit. These calls were amplified by a metro proposal made
by the Montreal Tramways Company in 1944, which consisted of one line
running under Sainte-Catherine and another under Saint-Denis,
Notre-Dame, and Saint-Jacques (Société de transport de Montréal,
n.d.).</p>

<p>Although this proposal never came to fruition, during and after the
war, it was becoming clear that a metro was necessary, as car use was
rapidly increasing to the detriment of public transit use, worsening the
city’s chronic traffic issues. It was also argued that a metro was
essential in maintaining Montreal’s status as a major Canadian city, as
Toronto was a rapidly rising metropolis that had begun developing its
own subway system (Gilbert, 2021).</p>
<p>In 1953, the Montreal Transportation Commission, a newly formed
organization with the primary goal of replacing the streetcar network
with a new bus network (Société de Transport de Montréal, 2004),
proposed another variation of the metro, building upon the 1944 plan.
However, this plan and all others made at this time failed to make it
past the planning stage.</p>

<h3>Thinking big: the Jean Drapeau administration and a renewal of

<div id="section-section-2" class="section level4">
<h4><em>1954-1960</em></h4>
<p>The push Montreal needed in order to finally commit to a metro system
arrived with the election of the Jean Drapeau administration. Drapeau
was the mayor of Montreal from 1954 to 1957 and from 1960 to 1986, with
a tenure distinguished by its ambition and major focus on transforming
Montreal into a larger, more modern, and more prestigious city. This was
largely spurred by the growth of Toronto in the early 1960s as it began
to overtake Montreal as Canada’s economic capital (Radio-Canada, 2021).
Drapeau spearheaded several iconic projects in the city, the metro among
them, with the goal of placing Montreal on the world stage.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Initially, Drapeau was opposed to the construction of a metro,
sharing the same belief as many politicians at the time that it was the
age of the automobile. However, this perception changed with a visit to
Paris in 1960. The Paris metro made use of a recent technological
innovation, rubber tires, which were quieter and allowed for faster
acceleration (Magder, 2018). Given that all other North American metro
systems were using steel tires on rails, inspiration struck: a metro
with rubber tires could be the perfect way to signal Montreal’s
innovation and progress to the world (Gilbert, 2021).</p>

<div id="section-section-3" class="section level4">
<h4><em>1961-1962</em></h4>
<p>With Drapeau’s approval, the Quebec government granted Montreal the
right to construct the metro. Drapeau proposed the first route for the
Montreal metro later that year consisting of three lines: orange (line
1), green (line 2), and red (line 3). The orange line was to run
north-south along Berri street, and the green line was to run east-west
across the downtown core. The red line was set to run from the downtown
core through Mont Royal, heading northwards before splitting into two
portions, one heading towards Cartierville and the other towards
Montreal-Nord. It would make use of pre-existing CN rails and would be
partly above ground (Gilbert, 2021).</p>

<p>The red line did not make it to the final metro plan, and was
cancelled in June of 1963. While several obstacles inhibited its
completion, such as the incompatibility between its planned outdoor
component and the non-weather-resistant rubber wheels to be used
(Magder, 2018), the main reason for its cancellation was that another
major opportunity had come knocking: Expo 67. The 1967 world fair was
seen as instrumental in positioning Montreal as a city defined by
modernity and innovation, and in putting it on the map at the global
scale (The Canadian Press, 2017). Once Montreal was set to host the
event on the island of île-Sainte-Hélène, located south of the city,
connecting it to the city center by public transit took precedence over
the red line.</p>
<p>The metro was officially inaugurated on the 14th of October, 1966 at
the Berri-de-Montigny station (now Berri-UQAM). The first 20 metro
stations were opened, and over one million passengers rode the metro on
its first weekend (Scott, 2016). The metro service gradually expanded as
stations were completed up until April 1967, when the yellow line was
completed and the orange and green lines had been expanded. This marked
the completion of the initial Montreal metro line.</p>

<h3>Era of optimism</h3>
<div id="section-late-60s-1975" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Late 60s-1975</em></h4>
<p>The late 1960s marked an era of formidable optimism in Montreal on
the heels of the new metro and Expo 67, which was a resounding success
as the most attended World’s Fair in the 20th century (Montreal Museum
of Fine Arts, 2016). There was the feeling that anything was possible,
and this optimism was reflected in the ambition of the projected metro
plans of the era, which included nine lines stretching far across the
island and over 112 km in length (Dufour, n.d.-b), although a project of
this scale was never realized.</p>

</div>
<p>The momentum generated by the major projects of the 1960s led to Jean
Drapeau’s re-election in October 1970, when he won with 92.5% of the
vote. The power this granted him led to his most ambitious and
controversial project of his tenure: the 1976 Olympics. Montreal was
awarded the 1976 summer olympics in May of 1970, and, at around the same
time, was subsequently granted a $430 million dollar loan (over 3
billion dollars today) for the expansion of the orange and green lines
as well as the construction of a new blue line. The province was to pay
for the expansion, leading to more ambitious plans for 1978 (Magder,
2017).</p>
<p>The blue line was to run from northeastern Lachine to Montréal Nord,
the west branch of the orange line was to be expanded northwards, and
the green line to be extended towards the southwest and east (Noakes,
2021). It was hoped that the extensions would promote development in
different parts of the city, particularly in less prosperous
neighbourhoods (Gilbert, 2021).</p>

<h3>Olympic fallout</h3>
<div id="section-section-5" class="section level4">
<h4><em>1976-1978</em></h4>
<p>Despite the lofty plans, several factors had inhibited their
completion by 1978. In the 1970s, Quebec was in the midst of
constructing a number of megaprojects, including the Mirabel Airport,
James Bay hydroelectric plants, and, most notably, the venues for the
1976 Olympics. Costs rapidly ballooned, particularly for Olympic
infrastructure, whose price tag had been driven up from $430 million in
1972 to $1.6 billion in 1975 (Gilbert, 2021). The explosion in costs and
associated rampant corruption dampened the optimism about Drapeau’s
grandiose vision of the city (Magder, 2017).</p>
<p>The cost of excavation for metro expansions shot up as well. Because
the rubber tires could not withstand Montreal’s harsh outdoor
conditions, the metro had no choice but to remain underground for any
future extension. However, this had become prohibitively expensive and
complicated to execute, particularly now that the metro reached into
less densely populated suburbs (Magder, 2017).</p>
<p>The explosion of costs prompted the provincial government, headed by
Robert Bourassa, to impose a moratorium on metro expansion on May 19th,
1976. This represented a fundamental shift in the way that public
transit would be approached in the city going forward. That said, the
green line was still expanded, with the eastern portion extended towards
Honoré Beaugrand station and the western portion towards Angrignon,
which is the current western terminus (Gilbert, 2021).</p>

<h4>1979-1988</h4>
<p>The Lévesque administration, which came into office soon after the
imposition of the moratorium, lifted it temporarily in order to expand
the orange line and construct the blue line (Magder, 2017). However,
much had changed since these extensions were first conceived of in 1971;
an economic slowdown in the 1980s , which was compounded by the
political and linguistic tensions that defined the 1970s resulted in the
downscaling of the original plan (Wilson-Smith, 1985).</p>
<p>Several new lines, which planners had proposed in the 1970s, never
saw the light of day. These included surface lines 6, 8, 10, and 11,
which were to boost urban development in underserved areas without the
prohibitive cost of building an underground line so far away from the
city center (Giansetto, 1982). An underground line, line 7, nicknamed
the white line, was also planned to run under Pie IX boulevard, a major
artery. However, all of these lines were rejected due to the economic
slowdown in Montreal. Many of these lines wound up being replaced by
commuter trains at a later date.</p>

<p>Changes to existing lines, however, were made. The orange line was

stations extending up to the Bois-franc train station cut to reduce
costs. Similarly, the central portion of the originally-planned blue

<div id="section-extension-to-laval" class="section level3">
<h3>Extension to Laval</h3>
<div id="section-section-7" class="section level4">
<h4><em>1990-2007</em></h4>
<p>No changes were made to the metro system over the course of the
decade following the removal of government subsidies for public
transportation in 1990 in response to the economic recession that the
country was experiencing (Chartrand, 1991; Kabore, 2014).</p>
<p>It took eight years for major news to finally arrive: the orange line
was to be extended to Laval. The population of Laval had reached more
than 330,000, and over 47% of their trips had an area served by the
metro as their destination. Given that many of these trips involved
driving to the Henri-Bourassa metro terminus and parking in the streets
nearby, major streets, the bridge, and the smaller streets surrounding
the station had become saturated. A Laval extension was therefore deemed
necessary (Ministère des transports, 1990).</p>
<p>In 2000, plans for the orange line extension to Laval were finalized,
with three new stations planned: Cartier, de la Concorde, and
Montmorency. Construction began in 2002 and was completed on April 26th,
2007 (Radio-Canada, 2022). The underground metro network has remained
unchanged since.</p>

<div id="section-barriers-to-expansion" class="section level3">
<h3>Barriers to expansion</h3>
<div id="section-s-present" class="section level4">
<h4><em>2010s-present</em></h4>
<p>Since the completion of the modern-day metro network, extensions of
the metro have been requested and studied, but have almost always been
traded for other projects or shelved altogether. A yellow line extension
southwards into Brossard was briefly considered, as there was the need
for a major east-west transportation corridor (CBC News, 2019), but was
ultimately replaced by a tramway project that is set to fulfill this
purpose (Corriveau, 2020). Similarly, an extension of the orange line to
the Bois-Franc commuter train station from Côte-Vertu has been envisaged
in metro plans that stretch back to the 1960s and remains highly
requested, but any official commitment from the provincial government
has yet to be made, although it has been researched several times
(Sargeant, 2022).</p>
<p>Despite the amount of the time that has passed since the last metro
expansion, however, the concept continues to inspire enthusiasm among
Montrealers. This was exemplified by the fanfare that surrounded the
proposed pink line, which was the cornerstone of Valérie Plante’s
mayoral campaign in 2017. Its ambition and potential to desaturate the
crowded orange line generated a tremendous amount of press and
excitement (Barbeau, 2018), but it was ultimately judged too expensive,
too similar to pre-existing lines, and unable to address the more
pressing need to improve public transit access in the east
(Radio-Canada, 2018). Nonetheless, the attention it drew despite its
tremendous, near-impossible scale was a testament to the power that the
distinctive image of an expanded metro holds (Tiranti, 2021). As
something easy to visualize and still largely associated with Montreal’s
rise as a modern metropolis, it is no wonder that potential metro
expansions remain highly anticipated despite the lack of progress in
recent years.</p>
<p>The exception, however, to this lack of progress is the blue line
extension to Anjou. Since its initial announcement in the 1970s, money
was put aside for it in 1998, 2001, 2001, 2010, 2015, 2018, 2019, and
2020 (Noakes, 2021). Only now does construction appear to have truly
begun, but the extension has already been fraught with complications.
While it was originally scheduled for 2026 at a cost of $3.9 billion, it
is now set to be completed in 2029 at a cost of $6.4 billion, due to the
jump in expropriation costs over the last few years from a jump in the
real estate market (CBC News, 2021). Interestingly, despite past
frugality with regards to the metro system, the project is still being
pushed through regardless of the cost, as citizens in the east end have
been waiting for “too long”, and there is a determination to finally

<h3>A new era for transit?</h3>
<p>Despite the consistent desire from residents for an expanded
underground metro system, the future of public transit in Montreal
appears to lie largely above ground. In 2016, the Réseau électrique
métropolitain (REM) was announced by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du
Québec, a partnership between the provincial government and Quebec’s
pension fund manager that took over financing of future infrastructure
projects in the province (CBC News, 2015). With its ambitious mission to
integrate the downtown core with the West Island, the North Shore, and
the airport using one electric, mainly above ground light rail line, it
is the largest public transit project in Montreal since the metro in
1966 (Réseau express métropolitain, 2019). Construction is now well
underway, and service to the Brossard section of the line is set to
begin in Fall 2022.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="stories/visuals/metro_evolution/REM_Carte_reseauMtl_EN.jpeg" alt="The Montreal metro network as of today, including the new REM, which is currently under construction. *Réseau Express Métropolitain*" width="600px" />
<p class="caption">

currently under construction. <em>Réseau Express Métropolitain</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>The REM, along with the South Shore tramway as a replacement for a
yellow line extension, appears to indicate an ongoing shift towards
above ground projects. Although the image of an expanded metro system
holds immense power, in the eyes of those footing the bill, it simply no
longer appears to be worthwhile. What was once a major investment that
would impart increased status on the city has largely become a source of
complication and exorbitant cost instead. It remains to be seen what
will be planned after the completion of the blue line towards Anjou, but
the trend is clear; above ground projects appear to be the future of
transit in Montreal.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of progress on the underground metro in recent
years, it still represents an important component of Montreal’s rise and
entry on the world stage. Whether it gets one more expansion or dozens
more in the future, its iconic imagery and importance to its millions of
users will ensure that its importance as a symbol of Montreal will
persist.</p>
