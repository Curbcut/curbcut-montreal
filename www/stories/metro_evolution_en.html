</div>


<p>Public transit in Montreal has undergone a tremendous transformation
since the early 20th century, with the metro system being central and
emblematic. The evolution of the metro has been far from linear, and the
decisions that were made often spoke volumes about the city’s priorities
and self-perception. This is the history of the Montreal metro, how it
arrived at its present state, and what its future holds.</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>Early transit in Montreal and the first metro proposal</h3>
<div id="section-section" class="section level4">
<h4><em>1910</em></h4>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, public transportation in
Montreal was dominated by an extensive network of streetcars that served
the growing population in the city center. As the population grew street
congestion did as well, leading to major streetcar punctuality issues.
The initial consideration of underground transportation arose from the
desire for a public transit system that could operate in spite of the
heavy traffic on the streets (Clairoux, 2001).</p>
<p>The Montreal Street Railway Company, which was in charge of the
tramway system, began to study the possibility of a metro system in
Montreal in 1910. At this time, other major European and North American
cities were in the process of establishing their own metro systems,
making it logical for Montreal to follow suit given its rapidly growing
economy and population (Société de transport de Montréal, n.d.). An
underground system could be both a solution to the issue of overcrowded
streets and an opportunity for Montreal to modernize in pace with other
major cities.</p>
<p>The initial proposal for underground transit was made in 1910,
consisting of a single line running mainly along Parc Avenue/de Bleury
Street (Dufour, n.d.-a). These tunnels were meant for circulating
streetcars underground as opposed to serving as a bonafide metro plan
(Société de transport de Montréal, n.d.). Despite this proposal and
several others being put forward in the following years, nothing
materialized in the early 20th century. The first world war, followed by
the Great Depression, prevented the approval and granting of funding to
any metro projects, as the city was plunged into economic crisis, and
street crowding was vastly reduced, alleviating the traffic issues
necessitating underground transit (Gilbert, 2021).</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>World war II and beyond: Reignited demands for a metro</h3>
<div id="section-section-1" class="section level4">
<h4><em>1944-1953</em></h4>
<p>Ramifications from the Second World War in Montreal increased
crowding in trams once again, in part due to the rationing of gasoline,
reigniting the calls for underground transit (Scott, 2016). These calls
were amplified by a metro proposal made by the Montreal Tramways Company
in 1944, which consisted of one line running under Sainte-Catherine
Street and another under Saint-Denis Street, Notre-Dame Street, and
Saint-Jacques Street (Société de transport de Montréal, n.d.).</p>
<p>Although this proposal never came to fruition, during and after the
war, it was becoming clear that a metro was necessary, as car use was
rapidly increasing to the detriment of public transit use, worsening the
city’s chronic traffic issues. It was also argued that a metro was
essential in maintaining Montreal’s status as a major Canadian city, as
Toronto was a rapidly rising metropolis that had begun developing its
own subway system (Gilbert, 2021).</p>
<p>In 1953, the Montreal Transportation Commission, a newly formed
organization with the primary goal of replacing the streetcar network
with a new bus network, proposed another variation of the metro,
building upon the 1944 plan (Société de Transport de Montréal, 2004).
However, this plan and all others made at this time failed to make it
past the planning stage.</p>

<h3>Thinking big: the Jean Drapeau administration and a renewal of
interest in the metro</h3>
<div id="section-section-2" class="section level4">
<h4><em>1954-1960</em></h4>
<p>The push Montreal needed in order to finally commit to a metro system
arrived with the election of the Jean Drapeau administration. Drapeau
was the mayor of Montreal from 1954 to 1957 and from 1960 to 1986, with
a tenure distinguished by its ambition and major focus on transforming
Montreal into a larger, more modern, and more prestigious city. This was
largely spurred by the growth of Toronto in the early 1960s as it began
to overtake Montreal as Canada’s economic capital (Radio-Canada, 2021).
Drapeau spearheaded several iconic projects in the city, the metro among
them, with the goal of placing Montreal on the world stage.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Initially, Drapeau was opposed to the construction of a metro,
sharing the same belief as many politicians at the time that it was the
age of the automobile. However, this perception changed with a visit to
Paris in 1960. The Paris metro made use of a recent technological
innovation, rubber tires, which were quieter and allowed for faster
acceleration (Magder, 2018). Given that all other North American metro
systems were using steel tires on rails, inspiration struck: a metro
with rubber tires could be the perfect way to signal Montreal’s
innovation and progress to the world (Gilbert, 2021).</p>

<div id="section-breaking-ground" class="section level3">
<h3>Breaking ground</h3>
<div id="section-section-3" class="section level4">
<h4><em>1961-1962</em></h4>
<p>With Drapeau’s approval, the Quebec government granted Montreal the
right to construct the metro. Drapeau proposed the first route for the
Montreal metro later that year consisting of three lines: orange (line
1), green (line 2), and red (line 3). The orange line was to run
north-south along Berri Street, and the green line was to run east-west
across the downtown core. The red line was set to run from the downtown
core through Mont Royal, heading northwards before splitting into two
portions, one heading towards Cartierville and the other towards
Montreal North. It would make use of pre-existing CN rails and would be
partly above ground (Gilbert, 2021).</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Metro construction began on May 23, 1962, south of Berri Street and
Jarry Street. Every station’s design was assigned to a different
architect, giving each a unique look, which is one of the defining
characteristics of the Montreal metro to this day.</p>

class="section level3">
<h3>A change of priority and the inauguration of the metro</h3>
<div id="section-section-4" class="section level4">
<h4><em>1963-1967</em></h4>
<p>The red line did not make it to the final metro plan and was
cancelled in June of 1963. While several obstacles inhibited its
completion, such as the incompatibility between its planned outdoor
component and the non-weather-resistant rubber wheels to be used, the
main reason for its cancellation was that another major opportunity had
come knocking: Expo 67 (Magder, 2018). The 1967 world fair was seen as
instrumental in positioning Montreal as a city defined by modernity and
innovation, and in putting it on the map at the global scale (The
Canadian Press, 2017). Once Montreal was set to host the event on the
island of île-Sainte-Hélène, located south of the city, connecting it to
the city center by public transit took precedence over the red line.</p>
<p>The metro was officially inaugurated on the 14th of October 1966 at
the Berri-de-Montigny station (now Berri-UQAM). The first 20 metro
stations were opened, and over one million passengers rode the metro on
its first weekend (Scott, 2016). The metro service gradually expanded as
stations were completed up until April 1967, when the yellow line was
completed, and the orange and green lines had been expanded. This marked
the completion of the initial Montreal metro system.</p>

<h3>Era of optimism</h3>
<div id="section-late-60s-1975" class="section level4">
<h4><em>Late 60s-1975</em></h4>
<p>The late 1960s marked an era of formidable optimism in Montreal on
the heels of the new metro and Expo 67, which was a resounding success
as the most attended World’s Fair in the 20th century (Montreal Museum
of Fine Arts, 2016). There was the feeling that anything was possible,
and this optimism was reflected in the ambition of the projected metro
plans of the era, which included nine lines stretching far across the
island and over 112 km in length, although a project of this scale was
never realized (Dufour, n.d.-b).</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The momentum generated by the major projects of the 1960s led to Jean
Drapeau’s re-election in October 1970, when he won with 92.5% of the
vote. The power this granted him led to his most ambitious and
controversial project of his tenure: the 1976 Olympics. Montreal was
awarded the 1976 summer Olympics in May of 1970, and, at around the same
time, was subsequently granted a $430 million dollar loan for the
expansion of the orange and green lines as well as the construction of a
new blue line. The province was to pay for the expansion, leading to
more ambitious plans for 1978 (Magder, 2017).</p>
<p>The blue line was to run from northeastern Lachine to Montreal North,
the west branch of the orange line was to be expanded northwards, and
the green line to be extended towards the southwest and east (Noakes,
2021). It was hoped that the extensions would promote development in
different parts of the city, particularly in less prosperous
neighbourhoods (Gilbert, 2021).</p>
</div>

<div id="section-olympic-fallout" class="section level3">
<h3>Olympic fallout</h3>
<div id="section-section-5" class="section level4">
<h4><em>1976-1978</em></h4>
<p>Despite lofty plans, several factors inhibited their completion by
1978. In the 1970s, Quebec was in the midst of constructing a number of
megaprojects, including the Mirabel Airport, James Bay hydroelectric
plants, and, most notably, the venues for the 1976 Olympics. Costs
rapidly ballooned, particularly for Olympic infrastructure, whose price
tag had been driven up from $430 million in 1972 to $1.6 billion in 1975
(Gilbert, 2021). The explosion in costs and associated rampant
corruption dampened the optimism about Drapeau’s grandiose vision of the
city (Magder, 2017).</p>
<p>The cost of excavation for metro expansions shot up as well. Because
the rubber tires could not withstand Montreal’s harsh outdoor
conditions, the metro had no choice but to remain underground for any
future extension. However, this had become prohibitively expensive and
complicated to execute, particularly now that the metro reached into
less densely populated suburbs (Magder, 2017).</p>
<p>The explosion of costs prompted the provincial government, headed by
Robert Bourassa, to impose a moratorium on the metro expansion on May
19th, 1976. This represented a fundamental shift in the way that public
transit would be approached in the city going forward. That said, the
green line was still expanded, with the eastern portion extended towards
Honoré Beaugrand station and the western portion towards Angrignon,
which is the current western terminus (Gilbert, 2021).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-moratorium-lifted" class="section level3">
<h3>Moratorium lifted</h3>
<div id="section-section-6" class="section level4">
<h4>1979-1988</h4>
<p>The Lévesque administration, which came into office soon after the
imposition of the moratorium, temporarily lifted it in order to expand
the orange line and construct the blue line (Magder, 2017). However,
much had changed since these extensions were first conceived of in 1971;
an economic slowdown in the 1980s was compounded by the political and
linguistic tensions that defined the 1970s resulting in the downscaling
of the original plan (Wilson-Smith, 1985).</p>
<p>Several new lines, which planners had proposed in the 1970s, never
saw the light of day. These included surface lines 6, 8, 10, and 11,
which were to boost urban development in underserved areas without the
prohibitive cost of building an underground line so far away from the
city center (Giansetto, 1982). An underground line, line 7, nicknamed
the white line, was also planned to run under Pie IX Boulevard, a major
artery. However, all of these lines were rejected due to the economic
slowdown in Montreal. Many of these lines wound up being replaced by
commuter trains at a later date.</p>
<p>Changes to existing lines, however, were made. The orange line was
extended to Côte-Vertu from 1980 to 1986, with the other planned
stations extending up to the Bois-franc train station cut to reduce
costs. Similarly, the central portion of the originally-planned blue
line was built between 1986 and 1988, with Acadie Station opening last
and remaining the newest metro station on the island of Montreal to this
day. Although consideration was given to an extension of the blue line
eastward towards Anjou, financial constraints likely ended up being too
prohibitive.</p>

<div id="section-extension-to-laval" class="section level3">
<h3>Extension to Laval</h3>
<div id="section-section-7" class="section level4">
<h4><em>1990-2007</em></h4>
<p>No changes were made to the metro system over the course of the
decade following the removal of government subsidies for public
transportation in 1990 in response to the economic recession that the
country was experiencing (Chartrand, 1991; Kabore, 2014).</p>
<p>It took eight years for major news to finally arrive: the orange line
was to be extended to Laval. The population of Laval had reached more
than 330,000, and over 47% of their trips had an area served by the
metro as their destination. Given that many of these trips involved
driving to the Henri-Bourassa metro terminus and parking in the streets
nearby, major streets, the bridge, and the smaller streets surrounding
the station had become saturated. A Laval extension was therefore deemed
necessary (Ministère des transports, 1990).</p>
<p>In 2000, plans for the orange line extension to Laval were finalized,
with three new stations planned: Cartier, de la Concorde, and
Montmorency. Construction began in 2002 and was completed on April 26th,
2007 (Radio-Canada, 2022). The underground metro network has remained
unchanged since.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-barriers-to-expansion" class="section level3">
<h3>Barriers to expansion</h3>
<div id="section-s-present" class="section level4">
<h4><em>2010s-present</em></h4>
<p>Since the completion of the modern-day metro network, extensions of
the metro have been requested and studied, but have almost always been
traded for other projects or shelved altogether. A southward extension
of the yellow line into Brossard was briefly considered, as there was
the need for a major east-west transportation corridor, but was
ultimately replaced by a tramway project that is set to fulfill this
purpose (CBC News, 2019; Corriveau, 2020). Similarly, an extension of
the orange line to the Bois-Franc commuter train station from Côte-Vertu
Station has been envisaged in metro plans that stretch back to the 1960s
and remains highly requested, but any official commitment from the
provincial government has yet to be made, although it has been
researched several times (Sargeant, 2022).</p>
<p>Despite the amount of time that has passed since the last metro
expansion, the concept continues to inspire enthusiasm among
Montrealers. This was exemplified by the fanfare that surrounded the
proposed pink line, which was the cornerstone of Valérie Plante’s
mayoral campaign in 2017. Its ambition and potential to desaturate the
crowded orange line generated a tremendous amount of press and
excitement, but it was ultimately judged too expensive, too similar to
pre-existing lines, and unable to address the more pressing need to
improve public transit access in the east of the city (Barbeau, 2018;
Radio-Canada, 2018). Nonetheless, the attention it drew despite its
tremendous, near-impossible scale was a testament to the power that the
distinctive image of an expanded metro holds (Tiranti, 2021). As
something easy to visualize and still largely associated with Montreal’s
rise as a modern metropolis, it is no wonder that potential expansions
to the metro system remain highly anticipated despite the lack of
progress in recent years.</p>
<p>The exception to this lack of progress is the blue line extension to
Anjou. Since its initial announcement in the 1970s, money was put aside
for it in 1998, 2001, 2010, 2015, 2018, 2019, and 2020 (Noakes, 2021).
Only now does construction appear to have truly begun, but the extension
has already been fraught with complications. While it was originally
scheduled for 2026 at a cost of $3.9 billion, it is now set to be
completed in 2029 at a cost of $6.4 billion, due to the increase in
expropriation costs over the last few years (CBC News, 2021).
Interestingly, despite past frugality with regards to the metro system,
the project is still being pushed through regardless of the cost, as
citizens in the east end have been waiting for “too long”, and there is
a determination to finally deliver on the promise of the extension (The
Canadian Press, 2022).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-a-new-era-for-transit" class="section level3">
<h3>A new era for transit?</h3>
<p>Despite the consistent desire from residents for an expanded
underground metro system, the future of public transit in Montreal
appears to lie largely above ground. In 2016, the Réseau express
métropolitain (REM) was announced by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du
Québec, a partnership between the provincial government and Quebec’s
pension fund manager that took over financing of future infrastructure
projects in the province (CBC News, 2015). With its ambitious mission to
integrate the downtown core with the West Island, the North Shore, and
the airport using one electric, mainly above ground light rail line, it
is the largest public transit project in Montreal since the metro in
1966 (Réseau express métropolitain, 2019). Construction is now well
underway, and service to the Brossard section of the line is set to
begin in Fall 2022.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="stories/visuals/metro_evolution/REM_Carte_reseauMtl_EN.jpeg" alt="The Montreal metro network as of today, including the new REM, which is currently under construction. *Réseau Express Métropolitain*" width="600px" />
<p class="caption">

currently under construction. <em>Réseau Express Métropolitain</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>The REM, along with the South Shore tramway as a replacement for a
yellow line extension, appears to indicate an ongoing shift towards
above ground projects. Although the image of an expanded metro system
holds immense power, in the eyes of those footing the bill it simply no
longer appears to be worthwhile. What was once a major investment that
would impart increased status on the city has largely become a source of
complication and exorbitant cost. It remains to be seen what will be
planned after the completion of the blue line towards Anjou, but the
trend is clear: above ground projects appear to be the future of transit
in Montreal.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of progress on the underground metro in recent
years, it still represents an important component of Montreal’s rise and
entry on the world stage. Whether it gets one more expansion or dozens
more in the future, its iconic imagery and importance to its millions of
users will ensure that its importance as a symbol of Montreal will
persist.</p>
