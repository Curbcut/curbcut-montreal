<p>
Residents and the municipal government came together to shape the
Saint-Michel Environmental Complex. This is a large 192-hectare site
that includes Frédéric-Back Park, composting and recycling facilities,
and the headquarters of Cirque du Soleil and la TOHU, a non-profit
organization that holds shows and cultural activities. What may now be
described as a space of serenity and peace was once synonymous with foul
odors and unbearable noise and air pollution. Located in between the
peri-central boroughs of Saint-Michel and Ahuntsic in the north of
Montreal, this former limestone quarry has seen tremendous change over
the past century.  
</p>
<p>
Within
<a href="https://montreal.ca/articles/le-parc-frederic-back-une-metamorphose-unique-18997">Frederic-Back
Park</a>, there is an art piece to commemorate the citizen mobilization
that played a signigicant role in the formation of this site. The
inhabitants of Saint-Michel had a long history of problems and
complications with the site linked to the Miron Quarry and the sanitary
landfill sites. The citizen mobilization for Frederic-Back Park is an
integral part of the history of this borough in transformation.  
</p>
<div id="section-the-miron-quarry" class="section level3">
<h3>The Miron Quarry</h3>
<p>
The Miron brothers took ownership of the first quarry in 1954, followed
by multiple purchases of smaller adjoining quarries, accumulating into
one large 192- hectare site in 1957 under the Miron name. Before 1914,
the space was split between many smaller quarries under various owners,
some of which continued to run their operations during the First World
War, positioning Saint-Michel as the mining hub of the city by the
1960s. The Miron Quarry along with the Francon Quarry, located just a
couple of kilometers away, amounted to 40% of the Saint-Michel area at
the time and served as an
<a href="https://vdocuments.pub/la-petite-histoire-de-saint-michel.html">emblem
of pride</a> for residents. 
</p>
<p>
The history of the quarry dates back 450 million years where its
limestone originated from a tropical seabed, even today various fossils
can be found within the rock. The Miron Quarry, among the other five
active quarries at the time, was known as the core of the city as it
produced the materials that were used in many of the iconic buildings
around the city of Montreal including the Central Station, the
Sainte-Justine Hospital, the St. Lawrence Seaway, Ville-Marie Square,
and the Complexe Desjardins. For many years, there was a sense of pride
for those working in limestone extraction, as
<a href="https://www.arrondissement.com/eng/tout-get-document/u1224-legendary-quarries-saint-michel">miners
understood</a> the tangible application of the material extraction,
stating, “that’s the hole from which Montreal comes… that’s our
concrete.” Without the limestone from the Miron Quarry, the materials
used in many of the city’s most iconic structures would have been
shipped in from outside sources.  
</p>
<p>
Transformation of the site over the years has been integrally linked to
the surrounding community’s lived experiences. Nestled in between the
boroughs of Saint-Michel and Ahunstic (including Domaine Saint-Sulpice),
two boroughs with vastly different demographics, the Miron Quarry served
as a landmark of economic prosperity and working-class struggles. While
some workers found pride in their work, many faced physical and
emotional challenges from the laborious work. Various incidents
including injuries and deaths occurred at the site of the quarry, and
poorly controlled blasting sessions led to increased local resentment. 
</p>
<p>
After the Second World War, many immigrants, mainly from Italy and
Portugal, relocated to Saint-Michel, where the neighborhood was quickly
growing, related to the increasing employment opportunities at the two
quarries. The bordering neighborhood of Domaine Saint-Sulpice, was
historically more affluent and predominately white. This disparity set
the scene for a discrepancy in community engagement and the amount of
people working in the quarry who were
<a href="https://papyrus.bib.umontreal.ca/xmlui/handle/1866/23757">exposed
to high</a> levels of carcinogens and other dangerous matter and work
environments. 
</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-transition-to-a-landfill" class="section level3">
<h3>The transition to a landfill</h3>
<p>
Around 1959, extraction at the quarry was picking up rampantly, and in
1968, to the disdain of the community, part of the site was converted
into a landfill. 36 million tons of solid waste, enough to
hypothetically
<a href="https://mitpress.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.7551/mitpress/9780262034951.001.0001/upso-9780262034951-chapter-003">fill
trucks</a> fill trucks lined up bumper to bumper from New York City to
Tokyo, were stored in the landfill site over the next 32 years. Around
the same time, residents of the district, including quarry workers,
assembled against the quarry and the landfill practices. As a marker of
this ongoing social and political struggle, they would eventually form
<a href="https://www.vivre-saint-michel.org/">citizens groups</a> that
advocated for the closure of these sites. The craters that remained
unfilled were often poorly surveyed and dangerous. For residents living
near the landfill, there were
<a href="https://mural.maynoothuniversity.ie/5057/1/Aoife_Catriona_Drumm_20140620142635.pdf">incidents</a>
of lower birth rates and preterm births for infants, as well as
incidents of higher-than-expected risks of developing liver, kidney, and
pancreatic cancer among those working in the landfill. Noisy trucks and
explosions, foul odors and poor air quality, often twice the legal,
levels permeated the neighborhood. 
</p>
<p>
Demonstrations in the form of protests, complaints and petitions against
the quarry and the landfill span back to the 1960s. These efforts were
done by separate groups whom were not in agreement about their desires
and demands for the future of the site. Nevertheless, as a response to
the community outpour of demands for the end of the quarry and landfill
activities, the City of Montreal finally acquired the Miron and Francon
quarries. While extraction ceased in September 1986, the true end of the
Miron Quarry did not come until April 17, 1988, when, through a symbolic
gesture, the two smokestacks were
<a href="https://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/1984845?docref=O68CZ3rUq3q-_yRZs7KCwg">demolished</a>
in front of a large crowd of Saint-Michel residents. While the community
was also pushing for the landfill to close due to the large presence of
trucks, noise and odor, it would take another 12 years for the landfill
to receive its last waste delivery before it permanently closed
operations in 2009.  
</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-saint-michel-environmental-complex"
class="section level3">
<h3>The Saint-Michel Environmental Complex</h3>
<p>
In 1995, the city began its masterplan to transform the former site of
the Miron Quarry and landfill. The Gazmont power plant was the first
installment in the new ‘Saint-Michel Environmental Complex’. The plant
is powered by recovered biogas from the Miron site, with a production
capacity of 25 MW, enough to power more than 10,000 homes.  
</p>
<p>
Since 2000, the city has planned an ambitious project for the creation
of Frederic-Back Park, which would become the symbol of revitalization
for the residents of Saint-Michel. Citizen engagement has been crucial
to the transformation of the site and is ongoing, and the city is making
efforts to maintain this engagement. 
</p>
<p>
In the early 2000s, the
<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/26195295.pdf">establishment of
solid partnerships</a> and consensus building among various actors took
place in the Saint-Michel community. While there were community
organizations before the 1990s, their work was often done in isolation
and often in opposition with each other, lacking an effort to consult
among the groups. In the 1980s and 90s however, the Saint-Michel
community unified around their fight against the quarries and landfill
operations, becoming a stronger force in the process to pressure the
city to shut down the sites. Progressively these organizations would
become more institutionalized, forming community committees that had
considerable influence on operations and decisions for local
redevelopment projects such as the Environmental Complex.  
</p>
<p>
A major shift has occurred over the past 30 years in Saint-Michel
regarding community power; a transition into consensus-building,
co-management, and consultations have become integral characteristics of
community groups in the district, allowing the community’s vested
interests to be more seriously considered by the governing party.
<a href="https://mtltimes.ca/montreal/st-michel-residents-demonstrate-over-cityaes-plans-for-francon-quarry/">Residents
believe</a> that citizens’ voices are the most important when it comes
to political changes among elected officials. 
</p>
<p>
While local community groups were mobilizing and partaking in consensus
building with the local government on the direction of the site, many
groups were still being excluded from conversations. New immigrants have
been notoriously excluded from economic activities, with high rates of
unemployment and lack of access to social assistance, despite efforts
from provincial and municipal levels of government to integrate these
populations into the neighborhood. 
</p>
<p>
As part of the transformation project, La TOHU and Cirque du Soleil
<a href="https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=UQPQnfKv5w0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=miron+limestone+quarry+montreal+resident+experience+community+&amp;ots=-roSwEQyQD&amp;sig=MINI_YbCqs-XIZOhuTlbSLWMXdc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">have
played a role</a> in the revitalization of the Saint-Michel
neighborhood. Offering <a href="https://tohu.ca/en">many free events</a>
as part of the Environmental Complex is a clear example of an effort to
keep the site accessible for the neighbourhood. The establishment of La
TOHU- and the community’s embrace of the organization- demonstrates an
ability to grow beyond conflicts that may have previously marked the
neighborhood. Community advocacy groups have played a critical role in
pushing La TOHU to make their events accessible to the public while
supporting other new projects in the neighborhood. There is a
<a href="https://www.reminetwork.com/articles/a-look-at-montreals-new-soccer-stadium-design/">soccer
stadium</a> that was built recently as a push to have more sports
activities on the site, but there is speculation as to whether this was
a good use of space given the limited number of people who can use the
stadium at a given time. Other features of Frederick Back Park include a
place to rent items throughout all seasons. Cross country skiers fill
the park in the winter and kite flyers, cyclists, and runners fill the
paths in the summer.  
</p>
<p>
The large citizen mobilization throughout the years in Saint-Michel has
left its mark on the borough. According to Jean Panet-Raymond, a member
of the community group “Vivre Saint-Michel en Santé”, many residents of
Saint-Michel are left with the impression (“trace de blessure”) that
their neighborhood is not good enough to have beautiful buildings or
nice parks. However, residents are also left with a feeling of hope and
encouragement that when citizens stand up together, they are capable of
influencing politics to change an old mining and landfill site into a
beautiful park for everyone to enjoy. Saint-Michel has become a vibrant
neighbourhood with many cultural, sports, leisure, health, social
support, educational, and socio-professional integration resources for
its residents. 
</p>
<p>
There is an opportunity for the transformation of the Miron Quarry to
serve as a model for the transformation of others quarries nearby such
as the Francon Quarry, but
<a href="https://mtltimes.ca/montreal/st-michel-residents-demonstrate-over-cityaes-plans-for-francon-quarry/">obstacles
are in place</a>, and it will surely take concerted efforts from the
community to bring these demands into action.
