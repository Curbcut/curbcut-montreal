<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Understanding what lies beneath Montreal’s
Grand Parc de L’Ouest</h1>
<h4 class="author">Josh Medicoff</h4>

</div>


<p>
In Montreal’s development of the forthcoming Grand Parc de L’Ouest
(GPO), a renewed drive to protect biodiversity and create greenspace is
illustrating the changing politics of development on the island.
</p>
<p>
In response to increasing climate risks and a dire need for more green
space on the island, Montreal is conserving and connecting a wide swath
of land on the West Island. But the GPO demonstrates the complex
tightrope Canadian cities are walking as they look to balance growing
populations, soaring housing costs, and climate change.
</p>
<p>
More than anything, the GPO is a rare example of urban greenspace
trumping development – and the lessons may indicate a new politics of
urban climate action.  
</p>
<div id="section-what-is-the-grand-parc-de-louest-gpo"
class="section level3">
<h3>What is the Grand Parc de L’Ouest (GPO)?</h3>
<p>
Spanning more than 3,000 hectares (ha) and 32 square kilometers, the GPO
is expected to be the largest urban park in Canada. It’s part of the
Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal’s (CMM) vision to protect 17% of
its territory from development, and the City of Montreal’s goal of
protecting 10% of the amalgamated city.
</p>
<p>
Collaboration is baked into the Grand Parc de L’Ouest’s DNA. It involves
the City of Montreal, two boroughs within the city
(l’Île-Bizard-Sainte-Geneviève and Pierrefonds-Roxboro), two
non-amalgamated towns on the West Island of Montreal
(Saint-Anne-de-Bellevue and Beaconsfield), and one village (Senneville).
It weaves together five existing parks between the West Island and
l’Île-Bizard, including l’Anse-à-l’Orme, Bois-de-L’île-Bizard,
Cap-Saint-Jacques, Rapides-du-Cheval-Blanc, and the agricultural park
Bois-de-la-Roche. The city is also buying land from private owners and
expanding the boundaries of l’Anse-à-l’Orme. In the process, it is
conserving some of the last unprotected greenspace on the Island of
Montreal.
</p>
<img src="stories/visuals/parc_ouest/flowers_bees.gif" width="30%" style="float:right; padding:10px;" />
<p>
Because biodiversity conservation is always more effective at a larger
scale, the GPO has the opportunity to make a dent in the urban
conservation sphere; and biodiversity is at the centre of the GPO’s
vision. The park will support a variety of existing habitats, including
wetlands, old-growth forests, swamps, fallows, and anthropogenic green
spaces.
</p>
<p>
Wetlands are particularly essential to protect, as they act as sponges
for the ebb and flow of rivers, and are also
<a href="https://www.savetheriver.org/river-info/ecosystem/">hotbeds of
remarkable biodiversity</a> (think of them as the mangrove forests of
the St. Laurence River). However, decades of concrete and asphalt
pouring, highway construction, and suburban development along the
St. Laurence has eroded the biodiversity and the sponge-like character
of these wetlands. That was made evident by the enormous flooding
experienced by Montreal and Laval in 2017 and
<a href="https://www.ledevoir.com/politique/montreal/561060/le-federal-injecte-50-millions-dans-le-projet-du-grand-parc-de-l-ouest">2019</a>,
killing two people and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in
damage.
</p>
<p>
Habitat diversity also creates species diversity. Of the 538 plant
species that thrive in the new park, 39 are endangered. And of the 331
animal species that call it home, 20 are endangered, including painted
turtles and grass snakes. The animal species in the park include 20
kinds of reptiles and amphibians, 253 bird species, and 36 mammal
species, ranging from red bats to weasels and, of course, beavers.
</p>
<p>
Owing to its size and the varied patterns of urban development in
Montreal, natural areas will not be the only landscapes that exist in
the GPO. For starters, McGill University’s McDonald campus is within the
park’s boundaries, as well as several golf courses on l’Île-Bizard.
Considering the negative effects golf courses have on biodiversity, it
will be interesting to see how the city decides to reconcile the sport
with its aims of protecting and promoting habitat. Additionally, several
agricultural plots – some in use, some not – exist within the GPO’s
boundaries. To that end, the City of Montreal is supporting organic
farms in the park and engaging visitors with education and
community-oriented project like food bank donations.
</p>
</div>
<div id="section-to-build-a-park-or-not-to-build-housing"
class="section level3">
<h3>To build (a park) or not to build (housing)</h3>
<p>
For some, the GPO represents a welcome rejection of profit-seeking
developers by an activist municipal government focused on saving
biodiversity. For others, it is a tragic and undemocratic rejection of a
years-long development that requires spending exorbitant amounts of
taxpayer money to expropriate private land.
</p>
<p>
The tension, then, at the core of the GPO is whether urban forests and
wetlands should be conserved or if thousands of new homes should be
built. The original plan, conceived as early as 2005, was to resolve
these competing needs by doing both. The Cap Nature project, as
developed and conceived by Les Immeubles l’Équerre Développements
Pierrefonds Inc., Les Immeubles L’Équerre Inc. and Quartier de l’Ouest
de l’Île, would develop half of the remaining unprotected lands near
l’Anse-à-l’Orme and add the rest to the existing park.
</p>
<p>
The project was simultaneously hailed as
“<a href="https://journalmetro.com/local/ouest-de-lile/917728/developpement-immobilier-pierrefonds-ouest-projet-montreal-se-prononce-contre-le-projet/">exemplary</a>”
by former mayor Denis Coderre but also fiercely opposed by community
groups like Sauvons l’Anse-à-l’Orme. Unlike most peripheral urban
developments, Cap Nature would have a mixed form and not consist of
exclusively single family homes. Apartment buildings, townhomes, and
some single family homes would populate the 5500-6000 new units being
built, requiring new roadway construction, extensive clearcutting, and
paving. The project would, in sum, attempt to satisfy the interests of
housing developments with concessions to greenspace.
</p>
</div>
<div id="section-understanding-greenspace-in-montreal"
class="section level3">
<h3>Understanding greenspace in Montreal</h3>
<p>
Despite large parks across the city, which include forests (Mont Royal)
and botanical gardens (Parc Maisonneuve), Montreal ranks low among
Canadian cities in terms of green space per capita. With 2.8 hectares
per 1000 people, Montreal ranks 29<sup>th</sup> out of 32 cities
analyzed in Park People’s
<a href="https://ccpr.parkpeople.ca/2021/"><em>Canadian City Parks
Report</em></a>. The message is clear: Montreal needs to invest in green
space.
</p>
<p>
Enter the Grand Parc de l’Ouest. Though officially announced by Projet
Montréal in 2019, the city has been looking to create more green space
for decades, culminating in its <em>Policy on the Protection and
Enhancement of Natural Habitats </em>in 2004. The policy included
creating 10 “eco-corridors,” of which several, like Rivière-à-L’Orme,
make up the GPO. In the <em>Policy on Protection</em> document, the city
acknowledges that protecting these spaces “is often perceived as an
obstacle to profitability” for developers, and that the policy was about
“reconciling environmental, social, and economic” benefits for
residents. This quote illustrates how conscious the city is of the
politics of housing developments on undeveloped land, but also that Cap
Nature was part of a longstanding attempt to satisfy both sides:
greenspace protection and housing development. It also makes Projet
Montreal’s decision to unilaterally reject Cap Nature in 2019 even more
of a shock from the typically piecemeal approach – more details below.
</p>
<p>
Since 2013, Montreal has adopted more aggressive climate and
biodiversity protection goals. The city’s 2013 <em>Biodiversity Report
</em>outlined a biodiversity strategy and action plan, acknowledging
risks threatening the St. Laurence river and its tributaries due to
urban growth. Additionally, the Communauté métropolitaine de Montréal’s
(CMM) <em>Metropolitan Land Use and Development Plan </em>(PMAD),
implemented in 2012, aims to green 17% of greater Montreal’s territory
(up from 12%).
</p>
<p>
The GPO has also received investment and regulation from the federal and
provincial government. In 2019, Justin Trudeau’s federal government
pledged CAD $50 million to the project, aimed mostly acquiring private
land in the expansion of l’Anse-à-l’Orme, protecting floodplains, and
mapping the area. In 2021, the Government of Quebec designated the
western end of Île-Bizard a “humanized landscape,” recognizing land that
transformed by human activity but that “remains in harmony with nature.”
</p>
</div>

class="section level3">
<h3>Building the Grand-parc-de-l’Ouest</h3>
<img src="stories/visuals/parc_ouest/water.jpg" width="100%" style="padding:10px;" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
<br>
<p>
Today, the Grand Park de l’Ouest is well on its way to becoming a
reality. Consultations were carried out through 2020, and the Ville de
Montréal is acquiring land on
<a href="https://journalmetro.com/local/ouest-de-lile/2758708/grand-parc-ouest-montreal-acquiert-terrain-ile-bizard/">Île-Bizard</a>,
<a href="https://journalmetro.com/actualites/montreal/2745653/le-grand-parc-de-louest-sagrandit/">Senneville</a>,
and in Pierrefonds West.
</p>
<p>
The one thing that’s missing? Cap Nature.
</p>
<p>
The demise of Cap Nature happened swiftly: in 2016, Projet Montréal,
Mayor Valérie Plante’s party,
<a href="https://journalmetro.com/local/ouest-de-lile/917728/developpement-immobilier-pierrefonds-ouest-projet-montreal-se-prononce-contre-le-projet/">pronounced
itself against the development</a>. It suggested building on the
multiple unused lots in Pierrefonds and highlighted that Cap Nature
would be poorly served by public transit. Though the decision and its
repercussions have been highly politicized, it represents a
paradigm-altering shift: cities <em>can </em>choose to protect over
developing and can choose to build density in existing, underutilized
spaces instead.
</p>
<p>
What’s also notable is the city’s firm rejection of a project it
initiated. In the mid-2000s, the city solicited developers for the area.
Crucially, Les Immeubles l’Équerre, one of the developers, owned about
360 ha of land and had spent “hundreds of millions of dollars” to
develop Cap Nature. Then, three years after publicly opposing the
project and two years after being elected, Projet Montréal unveiled the
GPO, rejecting up to
<a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/cap-nature-pierrefonds-west-project-in-pierrefonds-roxboro-sustainable-balance-between-natural-environment-preservation-and-harmonious-urban-development-617114473.html">$2
billion in purported economic growth</a>. The developers have been suing
the city for
<a href="https://www.journaldemontreal.com/2019/09/24/grand-parc-de-louest-cap-nature-replique-avec-une-poursuite-de-178-millions-1">$178
million</a> since 2019, but further details are slim.
</p>
</div>
<div
id="section-the-gpo-represents-an-interesting-insight-into-montreals-future-as-a-climate-leading-city"
class="section level3">
<h3>The GPO represents an interesting insight into Montreal’s future as
a climate-leading city</h3>
<p>
In another world, the wooded areas of L’Anse-à-l’Orme would be cut down
and transformed into pavement, glass, and houses. As housing prices soar
in Montreal even though its population has declined, we can only wonder
whether the city would have needed the excess housing Cap Nature would
have provided. In its place, however, is the construction of Canada’s
largest urban park, a space of connection, interaction, and protection
for the hundreds of species at risk that depend on it to survive.
</p>
<p>
The park and the process that birthed it, are far from perfect. For one,
we can question whether golf courses constitute greenspace. Furthermore,
the two major nations that exist in the Montreal region, Kahnawà:ke and
Kahnastà:ke, are not mentioned anywhere in Montreal’s planning
documents. (Kahnawà:ke was only consulted, it appears, by the Government
of Quebec’s decision to designate sections of Île-Bizard as humanized
spaces.) Maybe there is validity in developers, asked by the city to
develop a large plot of land in 2004, being angered by a sudden
reversal.
</p>
<p>
But in Montreal’s decision to expand L’Anse-à-l’Orme instead of
permitting new residential development, the city is rethinking its
strategy around protecting biodiversity and green space. This decision,
and the strategy behind it, seem to have worked: Projet Montréal was
re-elected in a landslide victory in 2021.
</p>
<p>
Responding to the developer’s lawsuit, Ms. Plante plainly responded: “It
will be a park.” And a park it will be.
