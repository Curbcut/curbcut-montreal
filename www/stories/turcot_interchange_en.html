<h3>Contextualizing Montreal’s history of urban planning</h3>
<p>
Much of 20<sup>th</sup> century transport planning in North America can
be described in terms of conflicts around the allocation of street
space.Battles over the relative importance of different modes, and mode
users, have been ongoing since the arrival of the commercially viable
automobile in the early 20th Century, with environmental, social, and
economic trade-offs that have repercussions throughout society. In
Montreal, as in many cities, the construction of major highway
infrastructure in the 1960s led to displacement of residents and extreme
altering of urban space to accommodate high capacity and high-speed
vehicle traffic, whose impacts are still felt today. The legacy of
car-oriented planning has intertwined with contemporary community-led
efforts moving towards more human-scale, pedestrian-oriented urban
space, as shown through the reconstruction of the Turcot Interchange
with its ever-changing plans for a pedestrian overpass.  
</p>
<p>
Montreal has recently undertaken several major large-scale
transportation infrastructure projects, including the reconstruction of
the Turcot Interchange - at the convergence of three urban highways near
the city’s downtown- which includes the ‘Dalle-Parc’, which would
provide pedestrian and cyclist access across the rebuilt Turcot
Interchange between the neighborhoods of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (NDG) and
the Southwest. The City of Montreal claims that it is increasingly
looking to support pedestrian-oriented projects as a pathway towards
sustainable mobility, but contradictions during the implementation stage
of the Turcot Interchange are proving otherwise.  
</p>
<p>
When discussing these plans for the distribution of urban space,
questions related to inclusion and participation in decision-making come
to the forefront, such as: who is being considered and prioritized in
the design and implementation of urban infrastructure projects in
Montreal? Whose voices are being heard, and who is being intentionally
left out of the conversation? These questions, among others, are
increasingly important to consider as Montreal grapples with how to move
forward with innovative ideas of sustainable development that are fair,
just, and equitable.

<h3>The Turcot Interchange</h3>
<p>
Throughout the 1960’s and 70’s, Montreal undertook several large-scale
infrastructure projects related to transport, housing, and spectator
sports, many of which still shape the character and image of the city
today, such as Habitat 67 and the Olympic Stadium. Much of this was
directly or indirectly linked to the 1967 World Expo held in Montreal
for which the city strove to present a modern vision to the world. The
Montreal metro system dates from this time as well, as does the original
Turcot Interchange, which opened in 1966 and 1967.  
</p>
<p>
The Turcot Interchange is located between two Montreal boroughs: the
Southwest borough and Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (NDG). The neighborhoods of
St-Henri and Little Burgundy, located within the Southwest borough, have
traditionally been working-class neighborhoods. Historically, these
neighborhoods have been affected by the suburbanization of industry and
the transformation of the Lachine Canal. The Lachine Canal had been
primarily used for industry and shipping, its closure to ship traffic in
1970 led to the loss of roughly 40% of the area’s manufacturing jobs
(Centre for Oral History and Storytelling, 2013). The once economically
vibrant communities suffered as population decreased by nearly half from
120,000 to 66,000 between 1961 and 1991. In a somewhat ironic turn, the
Turcot Interchange was built in 1967 at its original elevated height to
accommodate the passage of ships on the canal, rendering this
characteristic unnecessary just a few short years after construction. 
</p>
<p>
The Turcot Interchange connects three highways and is part of a larger
set of east-west and north-south highway corridors. The original
construction of the east-west corridor resulted in the displacement of
15,000 people and the bulldozing of 3,300 homes (Poitras, 2011). This
project gained access to funding because of an agreement among
municipal, provincial, and federal governments to integrate the project
into the Trans-Canada Highway system (Poitras, 2011). The selection
process for the location involved considering the physical geography
(including the St. Jacques escarpment and location of the Lachine
Canal), political climate, school districts, and religious
jurisdictional boundaries. Likewise, existing railways as well as
heritage buildings further to the south of the site were considered. The
Turcot Interchange was originally designed to carry 50,000 to 60,000
vehicles per day but carried up to 300,000 at its peak. The disruption
it caused for the surrounding neighbourhoods still affects them today.  
</p>
<p>
By the early 2000s, much of Montreal’s infrastructure built in the 1960s
was deteriorating and in need of repair. Decades of activism fueled the
demolition of the downtown Parc Avenue/des Pins Avenue overpass in 2005
(La Communauté Milton Parc, 2002). In 2006 a tragic collapse of the de
la Concorde overpass, originally built in 1968 led to five deaths and
six injuries (Leavitt, 2016). The tragedy of de la Concorde ushered in a
wave of debate about crumbling infrastructure, and the province of
Quebec announced plans to reconstruct the Turcot Interchange. This
massive project entailed simultaneously tearing down the “aerial
spaghetti” of interlocking overpasses, onramps, and connections which
were deemed in danger of collapse, and rebuilding a new interchange at
ground level (Aubin, 2009). In addition to aesthetic benefits,
rebuilding at ground level would be much cheaper. By the beginning of
its reconstruction in 2010 there were an estimated 300,000 vehicles
using the infrastructure daily, 30,000 of which are trucks, making it
the busiest interchange in Quebec (Radio Canada, 2013; Transports
Quebec, 2009). The cost of the Turcot Interchange doubled since its
original proposal, currently at 4 billion dollars, and the length of the
project took years longer than originally planned. 
</p>
<p>
Transportation planning in Montreal is complicated by the diversity of
actors involved in the process. Multiple levels of government
participate in decision-making and implementation: on the Island of
Montreal alone, the federal government has authority over bridges, the
province of Quebec oversees highways, the agglomeration of Montreal is
responsible for major local roads, and the boroughs and reconstituted
municipalities deal with local streets. In addition, multiple
stakeholders from the private sector and civil society weigh in on
public decisions: producers of trains and buses, engineering firms, and
construction companies push their wares and services, while
environmental organizations, trade associations and neighborhood groups
work to “sell” their views.  
</p>
<p>
Another complication in the planning process is the tremendous
institutional changeover; there were five different Montreal City
Mayors, eight Ministers of Transport, three Quebec premieres, and a
variety of other shifting stakeholders during the timespan of
negotiations for the planning of the reconstruction of the interchange.
Local governments and community groups have come together to form
multiple coalitions led by several organizations over the last decade,
and levels of political powers have fought while striving to find
consensus on a way forward.
</p>
</div>
<div id="section-stakeholders-and-background" class="section level3">
<h3>Stakeholders and Background</h3>
<p>
Before rebuilding the overpass, the Transportation Ministry of the
Quebec provincial government (French acronym- MTQ) went through a
legally mandated review process. Between 2009 and 2010, the MTQ
attempted to obtain approval from the Environmental Assessment Board
(French acronym - BAPE) (Developpement durable, 2018). BAPE rejected the
plans proposed by the MTQ multiple times because they included
demolishing 160 housing units and expanding automobile infrastructure
without providing adequate public transportation or active
transportation alternatives (CBC News, 2010b; Transports Quebec, 2009).
The MTQ stated that their primary focus was to relieve traffic
congestion by reconstructing the Turcot Interchange and address the
needs of the 300,000 vehicles that travelled through the interchange
daily. BAPE heard from over 90 citizen groups about the Turcot
Interchange who had come together to provide input and insight they
hoped would be considered before the Turcot Interchange was constructed
(CBC News, 2010b). For these groups, the main aim was to undo the social
and economic damage to these neighborhoods from the infrastructure
constructed in the 1960s. Their requests were to make the interchange
smaller, less costly and diminish the negative social and environmental
impacts. In late November 2009, the original MTQ proposal was officially
denied. 
</p>
<p>
In 2010, BAPE approved the plans of the MTQ after the MTQ incorporated
most of the recommendations suggested by BAPE, including decreasing the
number of housing units that would be demolished and creating a
pedestrian overpass called Dalle-Parc that would connect two boroughs,
providing an accessible link between two areas of Montreal which would
otherwise take three times as long to access and would include several
dangerous intersections. 
</p>
<p>
BAPE’s decision to approve the plans of the MTQ was quite controversial.
Leaders of Projet Montreal, at the time an up-and-coming political party
from the progressive Plateau-Mont-Royal borough, referred to the plans
as “scandalous.” Citizens and community groups were outraged (CBC News,
2010b; CTV News Montreal, 2010). Gerald Tremblay, the mayor at the time,
released an alternative plan for the Turcot Interchange which would
decrease the number of cars, eliminate destruction of buildings and
infrastructure in surrounding boroughs, and establish lanes dedicated
for public transportation (Gyulai, 2018). The plan was praised by
community leaders and politicians alike but was not enough to shift the
provincial plans (CBC News, 2010a). 
</p>
<p>
An alternative proposal by Mobilisation Turcot, an activist
organization, was projected to cut the expense of the Turcot Interchange
in half, take less than two years to complete, all the while addressing
the traffic congestion that the MTQ was concerned about (Mobilisation
Turcot &amp; le Groupe de recherche urbaine Hochelaga-Maisonneuve
(GRUHM), 2012). In addition to protesting and providing a counter
proposal, Mobilisation Turcot went to the Office of the Ministry of
Transport to deliver a letter signed by hundreds of citizens and groups
in and around Montreal “asking for a simpler and more ecological project
for the Turcot Interchange” (Mobilisation Turcot, 2013a). They argued
that the Minister of Transport was wrong in announcing that the MTQ’s
plans respected the laws of the provincial government when these plans
would, in fact, increase negative socio-environmental impacts. 
</p>
<p>
In 2013, the new mayor of Montreal, Michael Applebaum, stood in favour
of the plans for the Turcot Interchange but he later resigned due to
criminal charges followed by his arrest (Bruemmer, 2015). Most activists
of the movement were losing hope. The mobilizing and organizing seemed
in vain without serious political backing, and it appeared the only
accountability that the MTQ had to its citizens was through BAPE. One
last straggling protest was made that year, a yarnbombing knitted
graffiti of the Turcot Interchange in solidarity with several community
groups, before all the activism fizzled out for the next few years.
While this last protest had prominent media coverage, no amount of media
attention mattered without the hope of support from the city
government. 
</p>

<div
id="section-construction-and-removal-of-plans-for-pedestrian-access"
class="section level3">
<h3>Construction and removal of plans for pedestrian access</h3>
<p>
While the demolition and reconstruction of the Turcot Interchange went
forward, late in 2016 the MTQ quietly removed all plans for Dalle-Parc
from their website. Felix Gravel of the Regional Environmental Council
of Montreal (CRE-Mtl) wrote an open letter co-signed by almost 60
organizations and individuals to the Quebec Premier, expressing outrage
at the removal of the Dalle-Parc from the plans of the MTQ. The letter
explained that the MTQ was given permission to start building because
they “sold” the project based on the promise of the Dalle-Parc (Gravel,
2016). After a couple months of silence and no acknowledgement of the
Dalle-Parc plans, the MTQ confirmed that there were no longer plans to
build the Dalle-Parc in the Turcot Interchange. This announcement
frustrated and angered politicians and individuals in Montreal and
breathed new life into mobilizing protests regarding the Turcot
Interchange (Montreal-CTV-News, 2017). 
</p>
<p>
After an entire year of mobilization, more political news was released
about the Turcot Interchange: an MP questioned the new Minister of
Transport for Quebec on the Dalle-Parc and he promised that the MTQ
would leave space for it and that they would hold consultations to
discuss the Dalle-Parc further (Symon, 2017). Around this time Valerie
Plante was elected as the new mayor bringing Projet Montreal into
office. Plante has long been in favor of the Dalle-Parc and threw in the
support of the mayor’s office by announcing a $125,000 feasibility study
to be paid for by the City of Montreal (CBS-News, 2018). As of this
writing, the Dalle-Parc appears set to eventually move forward, but this
is highly contingent on the ongoing political climate. 
</p>
</div>
<div id="section-concluding-implications" class="section level3">
<h3>Concluding implications</h3>
<p>
An important insight to be gained from the story of the Turcot
Interchange is the need for accountability in the municipal government.
The Environmental Review Process (BAPE) mandated by the provincial
government greatly influenced the MTQ to consider the needs of citizens.
Because of this, the MTQ compromised on environmental and social issues
by decreasing the number of housing units to be destroyed and providing
access for pedestrians and cyclists to cross the interchange. However,
the MTQ’s ability to simply dismiss the plans for Dalle-Parc without any
consultation with BAPE was in part due to the lack of accountability to
ensure BAPE’s power to influence the project. It was community-led
petitions and activism that brought the Turcot Interchange project back
to the drawing board.
